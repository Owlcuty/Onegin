– ‘Not at all.’ – ‘Well, I declare,

– ‘Nurse, now, that’s not the question,

‘Ah, at last!’ their hostess cries,
‘Ah, boredom, that’s what’s bad, my friend.’
‘Ah, but the elegy’s so light,
‘And he…but we’ve time tomorrow
‘And here with our neighbour, Lensky,
‘And she’s?’ – ‘A Larin, and a dear.’
‘And tell me, which was Tatyana?’

‘And this is my own Tatyana.’ –

‘Can you really love the younger?’

‘Could I happily circumscribe
‘Could I, perhaps, just see inside?’
‘Dear, you can’t be well,’ replies,
‘Do tell me, Prince, now, to whom,
‘Eugene! Ah!’ – Light as a wraith
‘Eugene, I was so much younger,
Meet my hero of romance,
Before you, let him now advance.
‘Farewell now, you haunts of peace,
‘Farewell, you valleys, peaceful, dear,
‘Goodness how the years speed by!’

‘Here, young Vladimir Lensky lies,
‘How Tanya’s grown! Your christening
‘How is she then, your fair neighbour,
‘I’ll not keep you, but where is it,
‘I’m happy, am I not?’ he’d whisper.
‘I’m weeping….if you still recall
‘I am in love’ Tatyana sighs,
‘I can’t sleep, Nurse; it’s stifling!
‘I don’t see what’s so bad about it.’
‘I hate the fashionable circuit,
‘I must?’ – ‘Yes: for Tanya’s birthday.
‘I was not born for happiness,

‘Let’s go.’ They leave without delay,

‘Mine’, Yevgeny’s voice rings out,
‘My Grandison? …Oh, Grandison! Yes!
‘My darling, well, I’m getting old;

He lacked the passion and desire
His father had a fine career
‘My uncle, what a worthy man,
‘Never you mind that, just look…
‘No.’ – ‘With pleasure.’ – ‘When?’ – ‘Tonight.
‘Nothing,’ he answers, and is gone.
‘Now, approach!’ Calm and steady,
‘Nurse, go now.’ She swiftly ponders:
‘Of course not darling, only say…’
‘Oh there’ll be no end of babble,
‘Olga’s younger, yet she’s wed,

‘She’s not in love then?’ ‘Tell me who!
‘Should I turn back now, or go on? ...
‘So I joined another family,
‘Surely it’s not’ – Yevgeny muses –
‘Tanya!’ – ‘You know her?’ – ‘Long ago,
‘Tanya! What a notion! In those days,
‘Tell me will your friend appear?’
‘The man’s a lunatic, a boor,
‘The morning star will tremble bright,
‘The one who sat by the window,
‘Then happiness seemed possible,
‘Then, in that rural wasteland, far
From Romulus to our own day,
In his memory tucked away.

‘They’re all past they’re best’ he sighs;
‘To me Onegin all this splendour
‘To the left? Where? What’s to see?’ –
‘To whom, my dear, who is this he?
‘Up now, and no procrastinating:
‘Well?’ says Zaretsky, with force.
‘What’s to be done? She’s not a child.’
‘What do I haunt the ballet for?
‘What is it Tanya, dear?’ ‘It’s trifling:
‘What is your name?’ He moves on,
‘What that fat general?’ – ‘He’s gone!’ 
‘Where’s Anisya with the key?’
‘Where have you been, Onegin, where?
‘Where, oh where have you vanished,
‘Who’d have though it?’ – ‘What an age!
‘Whoever’s love for you’s more bright,
‘Whom does your sweet lyre hold dearer?
‘Whose glance, creating inspiration,
‘Why did you leave so early,’ Olga
‘Yes, but who is she? – ‘That’s my wife.’ –
‘Yet’, he reflects, ‘I must save her’,
‘You’re married then! I’d no idea!
‘You’re off again? Oh, these poets!’
‘You could afford a winter season,
‘You must widen the net, my dear.
Await the touch, involuntary,
Overcome with wit and passion,
Bowed to each acquaintance new,
Ingenuous naivety,
Did all that was required to please.
“Why the devil can’t you die?”’
﻿
And knew by heart, or thought he did,
Two whole lines of the Aeneid.
Found your fame, perhaps amazed,
Mention Juvenal by the way,
Or end a letter with vale,
Where you too were nourished or
				Prince Vyazemsky
As for finding ancient treasure
But kept the juiciest stories ever
He’d no desire to dig the dust
This ruthless critic, legislator,
Of history all turned to rust,
There I too strolled to and fro:
Though the North affects me so.

A birthday party, here a ball.
A roast-beef, rare, adorns the table,
Adam Smith was more his tome, where
Bored by Theocritus and Homer,
To tell iambic from trochee.
Always gave three balls a year
An instant hails the entrechat,
And Knyazhnin’s imitative rhymes. 
And Strasbourg pies, renowned in fable;
Deep in all things economic
And died with all he owed unmet.
Despite all efforts, or aspire
Satire’s most audacious master,
To give his life for poetry,
And gladly lived a life of debt
And our Katenin moreover
And truffles, luxuries of youth,
As his watch’s chimes repeat
As it grows dusk he takes a sleigh:
Boos Cleopatra, hisses Phaedra,
My youth fled by, enchantment clings.
On what the state relies, he told,
The wealth of nations was his topic;
But Fate took Eugene by the hand
Complete with wide-brimmed Bolivar,
Their dinner-table and their wife. 
For conversation’s art created.
He’ll have time still for the latter.
Which to visit first? No matter,
He saunters on the Boulevard,
Meanwhile in his morning dress
Parading there with all the rest,
So, often, while he’s still abed,
Tells him, now is dinner-time. 
Until his Breguet’s sleepless chime
Three notes appear, on a tray.
He had the gift of easy chatter,
Friends of Ruslan and Ludmila,
Where will my young idler call?
Then like a very sage could seem
Three houses offer a soirée:
What? Invitations? Swiftly read,
Touching lightly on each theme,
Here without an ounce of bother,
The Comet’s vintage, year eleven.
Chapter One
Denizen of the wings, he’ll fly
The French cuisine’s finest proof,
Glass on glass to drench the heat
Limburger cheese, soft and pungent,
The pineapple’s pure golden unguent. 
His beaver-collar shines away, 
Latin’s not in fashion now,
Of that last cutlet’s fiery fat,
The ballet’s beat he should be at.
Truth to tell, his knowledge slight,
Eugene Onegin, born and raised
The artiste’s flatterer and traitor,
To all unfaithful by and by,
Falling ill like that, and dying;
Onegin, to the theatre where
He breathes the air of freedom, at
Fonvizin shone there, Freedom’s lover,
Frost’s silver powders on it lie.
Or shouts for his Moina, merely
In order to be heard more clearly.
He’s off to Talon’s, calculating
Land of bewitchment! In past times
He arrives, the cork pops, heaven!
He knew enough I would allow
His friend Kaverin will be waiting.
Ozerov’s tragedies for years
Won tributes of spontaneous tears,
Shared wild applause, with Semyonova,
It summons up respect, one can
Translated the sublime Corneille,
Shakhovskoy, so sardonically,
Produced his hive of comedy,
There Didelot too crowned his day,
Where, in the shadow of the wings,
Listen now to my sad voice.
My goddesses! Where? Where are you?
Of your sublime clear poetry.
Such as they are, view these extremes
Indifferent to the world’s delight
To read an epigraph, and might
There beside the Neva’s shore,
Rushes to live, and makes haste to feel.
Lines more worthy of such themes,
Your spirit’s true simplicity
To Peter Alexandrovich Pletnev

Onegin has outpaced us all.  
Along the rows of darkened houses,
Down the streets where evening drowses,
The twin lights of the carriage throw

A flow of silhouetted stills,
Heads, in profile, edges crop,

28.
Past the doorman like an arrow,
Through the hall, our hero’s there,
Soaring up the marble stair now,
With a hand he smoothes his hair,
Enters. The room is gyring,
Orchestra already tiring,
A mazurka holds the crowd;
The crush intense, the noise is loud.
A Horse Guard’s spurs go jingling,
The light-footed girls sweep by,
As ardent glances swiftly fly
In pursuit, the dancers mingling;
While drowned by frantic violins
The jealous ladies whisper sins.
29.
In days of dream and ardour,
The dance-floor was my passion:
The safest place for a lover
To pass a note of assignation.
Oh you, esteemed husbands, now
My services to you I vow!
Pay attention now I beg you,
From my words take warning due,
You mothers, hear me too, I bid,
Guard your daughters most severely,
Raise your lorgnettes, watch them closely,
Or else…..or else, may God forbid!
I dare to write about it so,
For I stopped sinning long ago.
30.
Alas, on every stray amusement
I’ve wasted far too many hours,
Yet were they wholly innocent
I’d still wander those bright bowers.
I love youth’s frantic energy,
The crush, the lights, the gaiety,
The girls in fashionable dress,
I love their little feet, confess   
That, search all Russia though,
You’ll not find three lovely pair.
Ah, they made me long despair
Two slender feet…Now sad and cold
I still remember, and it seems
They yet can thrill me in my dreams. 
31.
But where, in what deserted strand
Madman, could your heart forget?
Ah, little feet where do you stand?
On what spring flowers are you set?
Pampered in eastern luxury
On our northern snows, so gloomy,
You left no trace, but loved instead
The sensual touch, on rugs to tread
And carpeted voluptuousness.
The call of fame, praise, I forgot,
My country: exile was my lot,
Was it for you all that distress? 
So youth’s happiness must pass,
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
32.
Diana’s breast or Flora’s cheek,
Are enchanting, friends, I find! 
Yet Terpsichore’s foot I’d seek
Far more enchanting, to my mind.
Since, foretelling to my gaze
Pleasure in a thousand ways,
Its subtle beauty lights the fires
Of a swarm of sweet desires.
Such I adore, my dear Elvina,
Beneath the table’s damask gloss,
In the springtime on the moss,
In winter, resting on the fender,
Or on the ballroom’s gleaming floor,
Or the granite of the shore.
33.
Recall the sea before a storm,
How I envied the waves then,
Each falling there as they form
To lie at her feet, in peace again!
How I longed to be those seas
Kissing her dear feet as they please!
No, never in the fiercest fires
Of tortured youth and its desires
Did I so long with painful ardour
To kiss the young Armida’s lips,
The roses of her burning cheeks,
Or her breast, filled with languor;
No, passion took no greater toll,
Nor ever so consumed my soul!
34.
Another day I bring to mind!
Sometimes in my fondest dreams
I hold that stirrup, blessed by time,
The little foot I touch it seems;
Again imagination blazes,
Again, a simple touch amazes,
Stirs blood inside my weary heart,
Again the pain, again love’s art! 
Enough of praise though for the proud,
Enough of my loquacious lyre,
They’re never worth the singer’s fire,
My songs inspired by that crowd.
Their words, their looks, both are sweet,
Yet prove as faithless….as their feet.
35.
And my Onegin? Half-asleep
He flees the ball, and finds his bed,
But Petersburg that restless heap
Its drum pounds fit to wake the dead.
The merchant and the beggar rise,
To his stand the cabman drives,
The milkmaids from Ochta go
Crunching over morning snow.
The city’s sounds swiftly wake her,
Shutters part, chimneys smoke,
Blue columns rising over folk,
The punctilious German baker,
More than once in white night-cap
Has opened up his serving flap.
36.
Worn out by the ballroom’s noise
And turning morning into night
Sleeps peacefully in blissful joy
The child of luxury and delight.

A full three hours at least he’d spend
A pedant in the details, no less. 
A second Chadayev, my Yevgeny,
Should disregard the subject of his nails;
Why quarrel with the age fruitlessly?
Beseech, elicit true confession,
Then his father passed away,
Custom is a tyrant, and prevails.
Fearing all the barbs of envy,
Listen for the heart’s first cry,
Was a very dandy in his dress,
Pursue love wholly, and thereby
Secure a secret assignation,
That here was wit and charm indeed.
What more is needed? All agreed

When shall I ever loose my tether?
Now! Now! With joy, I call aloud,
I pace the shore, wait for fair weather,
Signal each passing sail, each shroud.
When, storm-wrapped, shall I be free
To fight the waves, and scour the sea,
When will my wings begin to soar?
It’s time to leave this tedious shore,
This hostile climate where I wander,
And with southern oceans nigh
Roam beneath my African sky,
To mourn there for gloomy Russia,
Where I’ve loved, where I’ve suffered,
Where my heart has long been smothered. 
51.
Onegin and I planned to travel,
To feast our eyes on foreign lands,
But soon we saw our plans unravel,
Our fates lay in Fortune’s hands.
34.
And creditors had him at bay,
Each man to his own ideas,
He with lawyers round his ears,
Hating all this litigation,
Content with life, took a stance,
Relinquished his inheritance,
Finding it small deprivation,
Or else, reviewing distantly,
His uncle’s frail mortality.

A walk beside the lonely lake,
And far niente is my law.
Careless of fame, the brittle.
In ease and innocence I take
Dear liberty and leisure.
Every dawn produces more
Great shelves of books he read and read
He chose – a more than worthy goal,
I read a lot, I doze a little,
Once more resigned to being idle
Was it not, with such pure pleasure,
The thoughts of other men to rifle;
Then he turns away – and yawns,
Within its glow no interest dawns,
Ended on the Black Sea shore,
Far from Italy’s allure.

Some tell-tale, or vile inventor
Of over-elaborate slander try
To pair Yevgeny and I,
And ignominiously repeat
That I have here daubed my portrait,
Like Byron, pride’s perfect poet,
As though we can never treat
Of someone other, never own
To any but ourselves alone. 
57.
All poets, it seems to me,
Love in imagination,
To dream affection constantly
Was once my sole preoccupation.
My soul preserved its memory
The Muse gave it eternity,
And so in careless rapture I
Sang the maid on mountain high,
And captive girls by the Salgira,
But now my friends I often hear,
Your question ringing in my ear,
40.
For whom among that jealous crowd,
Do you now voice your thoughts aloud?
58.
40.
Rewards with its fond caress
Your pure, pensive incantation?
Who in your verse is your goddess?
No one, my friends, I tell you, truly!
Love’s madness, wild and unruly,
I suffered without hope or joy.
Happy is he who can employ
Fevered rhyme on such a theme
So he’ll double the intensity
Of the sacred flames of poesy,
Follow in Petrarch’s steps, seem
To ease heart’s suffering, find fame:
But I was mute, foolish in the game.
59.
Love faded then the Muse appeared,
My darkened mind grew clear again,
Now free, my verse no longer feared 
Music’s magic, thought, and pain.
I write, my heart no longer suffers,
My pen I find no longer wanders,
Sketching women’s legs and feet,
Beside some lines still incomplete.
The cold ash hides no smouldering ember,
I’m grieving still, but free of tears,
The storm that shook my soul for years
Soon, soon my mind will not remember:
Then what an epic I’ll contrive,
A poem in cantos, twenty-five! 
60.
I’ve sketched the underlying plan,
The hero’s name I’ve given too;
My rhyming novel’s well in hand,
I’m ready now for chapter two.
I’ve scanned the pages of my fiction,
And though they’re filled with contradiction,
It’s not my job to work them through.
The censors must have work to do.
To journalists for their consumption
I’ll feed the proceeds of my pen.
Go, little book: find Neva then,
My newborn work, my sweet creation,
Earn me the first fruits of fame,
Noise, incomprehension, blame!
Chapter Two
O rus! 
Horace
O, the country! O, Russia!
40.
Our bored Yevgeny’s place of leisure
Was in fact a fine estate,
Where lovers of life’s simple pleasure
Would thank the heavens for their fate.
The manor house was quite secluded,
Screened by the hills when storms intruded,
Beside a river. On every side,
Stretched the pastures far and wide,
Golden cornfields, flowery meadows,
Here a village, there another,
Cattle grazing in the clover,
Parkland, overgrown, soft shadows
Deepening the garden’s shade,
Where the pensive dryads played. 
40. 
The stately pile was nobly planned
As such fine mansions ought to be,
Firmly founded on the land,
With all the taste we used to see. 
Every salon high and handsome,
Damask in the drawing-room,
Ancestral portraits stretched for miles,
Stoves shone with ceramic tiles. 
All this is out of fashion now,
Though why it is, who can say,
Yet none of it, the whole display
Moved our hero, I’ll allow,
An ancient house or one new-born
Both of them would make him yawn.
41.
In that room, where the aged fellow
For forty years had berated
His housekeeper, gazed out the window,
Killed the flies, and rusticated,
That simple stall, with oaken floors
Settee and table, chests of drawers,
And not the least ink-stain around,
Onegin searched the cupboards, found
In one a ledger taken hostage,
In another home-made brandy,
A stoneware jug of cider handy,
An Almanack, of year eight vintage:
The old man had no time to look
At any more demanding book. 
41.
Alone amongst his new possessions,
Simply to pass the time away
Yevgeny took, in dreamy sessions,
To running things the modern way;
A prophet in the wilderness,
He scrapped the old corvée, no less, 
And substituted light quit-rent,
The serfs applauded his intent.
His calculating neighbour though,
Was not enamoured, thought him mad
Saw nothing good, predicted bad,
While others sneered at the show,
But one and all, in truth, agree
He’s a menace in the first degree.
5.
At first the neighbours visited,
But as, at the back porch, was saddled
His stallion, a Don thoroughbred,
And he then rapidly skedaddled,
Once he heard, near his abode,
Their carriage wheels, briskly rode,
They took offence, and once offended
The brief acquaintances were ended. 
41.
A mason, and forever drinking,
Wine by the bottle, never blinking,
Won’t kiss the ladies’ hands, what’s more
Says yes and no, but never sir
Or madam’ so they all concur.
6.
Meanwhile another landowner
Newly arrived on his estate,
His neighbour, caused an equal stir,
For reasons that I’ll indicate.
Vladimir Lensky, is the man
Handsome, young, a Kantian,
Whose soul was formed in Göttingen,
A friend of truth: a poet then.
From misty Germany he brought
The fruits of learning’s golden tree,
His fervent dreams of liberty,
Ardent and eccentric thought,
Eloquence to inspire the bolder,
And dark hair hanging to his shoulder.
7.
Un-blighted by the world’s cold malice,
His generous spirit still could bless
With warmth a comrade’s manly kiss,
Or a young girl’s shy caress.  
At heart a simple innocent,
To whom hope her brightness lent,
In life’s fresh glow, he still could find
Enchantment, with an unspoiled mind.
He sweetened with delightful dreams
The doubts that stirred in his soul
Life was a riddle, and its goal
A puzzle that seduced, it seems.
Over it he’d rack his brains,
Seeking miracles, for his pains. 
8. 
In kindred souls too he believed,
That somewhere there was another,
Who longing to unite them, grieved
For him alone, the eternal lover;
Trusted also his friends were there
Ready to save his honour, share
His prison, loyal, prepared to fly
To his defence should slander lie;
That there existed chosen vessels,
Holy friends of the human race
Immortals clasped in fate’s embrace,
Who with radiant light would wrestle,
One day, to illuminate and bless
A future world with their caress. 
9. 
Compassion, and indignation,
A pure devotion to the good
The bitter-sweet lure of ambition,
From the start, had fired his blood. 
The world he wandered with his lyre,
Imbued with true poetic fire,
Under Goethe’s, Schiller’s skies,
They the masters, to his eyes. 
Blessed with skill, the Muses’ art
He never managed to disgrace,
In his songs kept pride of place,
For the passions of the heart;
Moments of grave sublimity,
The charms of sweet simplicity.
41.
He sang of love, to love subjected,
Clear and serene his tune,
As a girl’s thoughts, unaffected,
A child’s slumber, or the moon,
Sailing the untroubled skies,
Queen of mysteries and sighs. 
He sang of parting and of sorrows,
Misty climes, and vague tomorrows,
Of roses in some high romance;
Sang of all the far-off lands
Where on quiet desert strands,
His living tears obscured his glance;
At eighteen years he had the power,
To sing of life’s dry withered flower. 
41.
In that rural wilderness, Yevgeny
Alone, to Lensky’s taste inclined.
The pleasures of the local gentry
Not such as to engage his mind.
The young man fled their noisy chatter,
Their solid grasp of every matter,
Concerning harvesting, or wine,
Their family, or the hounds, no shine
There of wit, true conversation,
The glow of the poetic flame,
No flavour of the social game,
No sentiment to temper reason,
While the babble of their wives,
Was dross enough for many lives. 
41.
Lensky, wealthy and good-looking,
Was thought something of a catch;
Thus the country view of hooking
Any fish to make a match;
Marry their daughter, was the plan,
To this half-Russian gentleman.
The talk turns with quiet persistence
To a bachelor’s sad existence,
When he shows, with the samovar,
And Dunya sits to pour the tea, 
Before, to prompt her minstrelsy,
They bring on the poor child’s guitar,
And then she squeaks (Oh Lord, above!)
42.
42.
But Lensky, lacking the desire
To bear the marriage-yoke as yet,
42.
42.
42.
43-44.
43.

Nor long years of separation,
Of your perfection too, no less

It’s true we don’t possess good taste,

Some profoundly moral tale,
In working something she’d designed.

The secrets of the grave, the pages
Of life itself and destiny,
Were all their constant study.
The poet burning with opinion
49.
And ruled him like an autocrat.

The less we show our love to woman,
5.
From his uncle’s man, to say
His uncle lay at death’s door, better
Before the mirror, then would leave
Say farewell without delay.
Yevgeny read the gloomy note,
His dressing room, I’ll not deceive,
Prepared, for the sake of gold,
Yawning the while as he raced,
In masculine attire displayed
Then grasped the instant by the throat,
Took to the road, went post-haste,
Like Venus if she’d condescend
Silently impart love’s teaching!
Then later, intimacies meeting,

Possessed of the poet’s finer rage,
Is doomed to feel such love, and moan:
Always the one pure constant dream,

Between them every disputation
A bon mot, with a fierce headache,
Its madness and its rage to live.
Youth is a fever, let’s forgive
And fail to offer a word, to make
Sparked a deeper train of thought,
The histories of every nation,
And though a womaniser fine,
Good and evil, what science taught,
The prejudices of the ages,
In the end he too grew bored
For all those years long sped by?
Silently to yawn and sigh

Her sister’s name was…Tatyana,
Let me describe her elder sister.
Reader, I’ll enhance the vista,
The new ones simply antiquated,
The old ones utterly out-dated,
Didelot too is quite the bore.’
9/10.
A General’s, noble, to my mind.
A Kalmuck, in a ragged smock, 
A Lancer, who was loved again,
Our secret balm, a tear, a sigh…
Yet now we only see in her
A street-light, though inferior. 
A Lancer, with undying devotion…
Always humble, always truthful,
Always smiling as the dawn,
Like the poet’s life as simple,
Sweet as the kiss of love, that’s born
Of sky-blue eyes, a heavenly blue,
Flaxen hair, all gleaming, too,
Voice, manner, slender waist, 
Such was Olga…you can paste 
Her description here from any
Novel that you choose to read,
A charming portrait, yes, indeed,
One I adored, but now it bores me.
Recalling many a lost love there
Sentimental, free from care,
All that, to sate boundless caprice,
Benediction we drank deep!
Here’s the first use of it made
In romance, the first time ever
It’s been willingly displayed.
Why not? It has a pleasant sound,
In the water’s smooth still glass,
Recalling romance of time past,
Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
In silent joy, of night’s bounteous
Ingenious London without cease
Like prisoners released in sleep,
To read him, nor preferred really
To roam the forests green, so us,
Sends us through the Baltic trade,
How utterly himself forgetting!
A London dandy safely classed
A Muscovite in Childe Harold’s cloak,
A Petersburg ball, in all its glory,
A Tsimlyansky, for a toast;
A ballroom tyrant by the door
Had called to show their true devotion,
Or enjoy the funeral, as you are. 
And for you, knowledgeable race,
Ate, drank, then left, solemnly
Pleased that they had done their duty.
But there’s a risk in such fiction,
Now our Eugene’s a countryman,
So, Vladimir more captivated
With vineyard, water, wood, and field,
Though I’m an adept at description,
And when he wanted to refer
Did full justice to the rest,
The dead man buried priest and guests
I might try to tell the whole tale,
The heart of a confirmed coquette!
A bit of this a bit of that,
A black-cowled monk, or if a hare
Early, the will to rule appears,
A block of snow will slowly glide,
A book, a walk, sleep that’s deep,
A bottle of sparkling wine,
A bottle pops; the wine now flows
A branch leans down to snag her hair,
At home he renders it apparent
A brief snow-flurry spirals by,
A brilliant azure lights the sky,
A caricature he next designed
A casual guest comes, sits and plays,
A cherub, motionless, red-faced,
A classicist, and pedant both,
A clever scheme of rural song,
A clue the index may afford her,
A creature heartless and amoral;
A cure for my sad history,
Be more amused by something light.
A dandy, ensign in the Guards. 
A dark reproach in every word.
A dark-eyed, white-skinned maid to keep
A decent sort, though yet conceding
A delicate and trembling ridge,
She loved to greet the break of day,
When the light has barely shown,
As the stars’ choir fades away,
And the edge of earth grows brightly,
A devil in pride, or yet an angel,
A drop of that dark fragrant stream;
A duel in the morning light, 
A dwarf who sports a tail; and that,
A faithful shadow, nothing more;
A fashionable glossary,
A fatal wound on some young friend,
A few steps from eternity,
A fierce desire to love and live?
A fiery will, a lively mind,
A fisherman’s fire: Tanya there,
A flower in deepest grass, alone,
Whatever chapter most entrances,
In Richardson or in Rousseau.
Her father saw no harm in reading,
A foreign tongue it is that slips,
His taste was of a former age.
And since he never read a page,
He thought them quite innocuous,
And never bothered for a moment
About the volume’s true content,
That slept beneath her pillow thus.
His wife was quite another one,
Since she was mad for Richardson.
A fresh demon will inhabit
Richardson she loved quite madly,
Though not indeed that she was one,
A frightful witch with a goatee;
A frosty night: the sky is clear,
A gateway in a lane: at last!
A girl will often change her lover,
A glimpse of life, or a jest,
With tumult in his heart and head,
Betrothed though against her will:
A glittering stream beside a garden!
A great fat goose her red-webbed feet
A harmless, and delightful dream. 
A haze of tears to cloud her eyes.
And all their echoes false to us,
We still tremble, being sober,
He noticed nothing, did not care.
Their violence seems ridiculous
When their unbridled stirrings cease,
Nothing touched his feelings there,
A host of nymphs around her, so
A household, a neglected wife,
A hymn can reach, or people’s praise,
A lady approaches the hostess,
A lexicon, a parody?
A liar yet, Lubov Petrovna;
A light dinner, not too pensive,
A lily in the morning dew,
Habit brought her quiet content,
Habit joy’s surrogate, heaven sent. 
A little note then for her hero
Habit soothed her agony,
Nothing else could end her grief,
Until a fresh discovery
Consoled her and brought relief.
In their hours of work and leisure
A little pale and thin, but all
A lively horse and responsive,
A love that’s innocent, sincere.
All went smoothly from that day,
A meaning that her heart obeyed. 
A melancholy oddity,
A memory to the mind may bring
A mere five hundred years) our roads
Alas, poor Yorick!’ he lamented,
And at the table, dinner served,
And died just before his dinner.
And full of grief that he was dead,
And so grew old, like all things mortal,
And was wept for by his neighbours,
His virgin fire a living coal.
Never having felt love’s blade,
When but a boy his heart was captured,
Over the darkened stones instead,
The speeding cabs whirl out of sight
Askance his opera-glass now centres
At Whitsuntide, their tears they’d shed
At his neighbour’s grave, and truly
Beneath this stone, rests quietly here. 
By Olga, and as one enraptured
By his children and his wife.
Considered it a certain thing.
Could alter Lensky’s loyal soul,
Dimitry Larin, a poor sinner,
Due rank and custom they observed.
Elegy penned a madrigal. 
Even now I hear him say,
Filled with grace and innocence,
Plain, devoid of ceremony. 
They’ll grumble, swap the latest gossip,
Laugh at whatever tickles them,
Hours roll on, and then, again,
Olga’s here with tea to sip,
Then supper, bedtime, by and by,
The hour when all must say goodbye.
Folksongs, and the wedding chorals, 
They held to, in their peaceful state,
Traditions of the ages past,
So on Shrove Tuesday always ate
Russian pancakes, and they’d fast
Twice a year, loved Christmas carols,
Like fresh air they loved their kvass,
On the flowers, their eyes quite red,
The congregation sit and yawn,
When through the thanksgiving Mass,
Their sentiments were re-born.
They exchanged their childish vows,
Under the oak-trees’ sheltering boughs,
From every pleasure he retreated,
God’s servant and a brigadier,
He’d led a good and simple life,
He hoped Olga and I would wed,
The husband was the first to pass
Through the grave’s gloomy portal,
Wore the funeral crown at last.
Now he rested from his labours,
His epitaph discreetly sighs:
Their fathers saw them marrying,
Onegin, shut himself indoors,
Under her parent’s gaze she grew
Where his honoured dust now lies
Would join the literary bores,
He notes the boxes, serried places,
He watched her as she sang and played.
Lensky, for a funeral
Nor foreign beauties, foreign views,
Returning to his home, young Lensky
Went to pay his fond respects,
Nor hours given to the Muse,
Paid tribute with a tear. ‘Who’s next?
Nor study, nor loud celebration,
Took his old medal for a toy!
When I was but a little boy,
You too Yevgeny quite deserted.
On unknown faces, ranked, complete.
The one poor Ovid used to sing,
When all of Petersburg’s abed,
You too, sweet girls, who late at night,
Threads the rows among the feet,
The science of the tender passion
A mild rebuke, a sharp remark,
Then too, with fervent weeping,
He sat down and wrote another,
Honouring, where they lay sleeping,
Both his father and his mother…
Alas! From life’s dark furrows rise
The human harvest to our eyes,
Rise and ripen, briefly nourished,
Where they fall, others flourish…
So our heedless race today
Grows recklessly and fills the room,
Pushes its grandsires to the tomb.
We too, we too, the same old way;
Our grandchildren think it no crime 
To crowd us out before our time!
A mirror on the moon, but learns
So, enjoy the fleeting hour
Of this fickle life, my friends!
I count myself free of its power,
Know its worth, and how it ends.
I’m blind to all its illusion,
Yet within my heart’s confusion,
Distant hopes will sometimes start:
It would be painful to depart
Leaving not a trace behind.
I live, I write but not for praise;
But only, it seems, from my days
To leave a name for fate to find,
That one line in the memory
May speak, like a fond friend, of me.
A mirror underneath the pillow,
My verse may touch someone’s heart,
Some stanza, preserved by fate,
Some fragment of my precious art,
Saved from Lethe’s darkened spate.
Perhaps too (oh, flattering hope!)
A missive that declares his passion.
Glittering, the first winter snow
Stars the frozen shores below. 
A mob-cap and a quilted gown. 
A moment since, imagination
A moment: that was all it took.
A monstrous crew, imagine it!
A needle, never once excelled,
The ageing laurels of my crown!
Chapter Three
Elle étoit fille, elle étoit amoureuse.
Malfilâtre
She was a girl, she was amorous.
A new face claims our attention.
A nightingale, from woodland gloom
Goodbye, Eugene, I must be leaving.’
A noisy crowd; and fighting, larking,
You fritter away your evenings?’
A paragon of pure perfection.
Aren’t you bored to death, dear God,
Killing the hours dozing there?’
A parody of southern winter,
I can’t see it. Here’s what you’ll find 
I imagine (say, if I’m right):
A past acquaintance, and relation.
She quietly took her husband’s measure,
With that secret, gave her dictat,
Sweeter, in night’s embrace, by far.
A pipe of amber from Istanbul,
All make for home in the end,
All this fresh to Onegin, till
Its doomed despite my interdiction,
With such ephemeral happiness,
At more beefsteak and Strasbourg pie
Believe all things are for the best:
Let him but breathe the passing fiction,
Endless bottles of sparkling wine
The sarcastic and the chill
Friends and friendship were confusing,
He thought: what folly to work ill
Words upon his lips were still.
Since even he at times would sigh
My disenchanted opera-glass, 
Tired of the laughter of the age,
Of mortgaging his land quite weary.
A pleasant-natured lad but wild.
A poet? No, he wasn’t one,
A poor second-hand illustration,
A priceless treasure, here to stir
A prize which Tatyana bought
A profile of contemporary man
A pulse, the blood’s living heat,
A quiet retreat from the storm.
I once spent my sweetest days?
Meanwhile Onegin’s first session
In happiness, in idle ways,
Until (a wealth of thanks conceive),
They exit; Lenksy loth to leave.
A rainbow glitter on the snow.
Homeward they go the shortest way,
A roaring in her ears, eyes dazed…
A role as husband, father; found
She’s followed closely by the bear!
A satanic monstrosity,
A scholar, in a yellow shawl,
A scribbled, and mis-spelt, rendition.
A second quarrel, then they sigh,
A seething torrent, foaming, pours
A sensitive and handsome face.
A serving-lad hands round the cream.
A shadow, pale. Ah, for one line!
A shepherd’s pipe wakes the dale.
It’s bound at least to make me ill.’ 
A sight of the true original,
A simple Russian family
As though she had a private sorrow’
Sad as Zhukovsky’s Svetlana,
No matter, hope in childish guise
A simple Russian scene, by night,
A simple letter, free of guile,
If I were a poet, as you are
Olga’s less alive by far,
Just like those Van Dyck Madonnas,
Pretty yes, with that round face,
As the foolish moon in space,
The foolish horizon honours.’
Vladimir thought him quite wrong,
Yet diplomatic, held his tongue.
All the neighbours were seduced.
At the Larins had produced
Looked for a divorce tomorrow,
On one and all a strong impression,
Then sips the news from some vile font,
There was no end of speculation,
Then plunged into domestic labour.
A single boat with outspread oars
A single image as it were:
A skeleton haughtily in place;
A snowdrift shifts, a shaggy bear,
A soldier-husband, a campaign.
A song we love, a merry song,
A soul for passion’s fires designed,
A soul so trusting, in that fashion.
Tanya recovers from her fear,
Tatyana listened, with vexation,
To all this; yet, an innocent,
Felt inexpressible elation,
At the least unguarded moment.
A thought took root in her heart,
So a seed begins to start
Heated by the warmth of spring,
And time gives nurture to the thing.
Her dreams had long since set her yearning,
For that fatal sustenance,
Fired by longing, circumstance,
In solitude her heart was burning, 
Crushed by adolescent gloom,
Her soul was waiting…but for whom?
A spirit tuned to all creation?
The one awaited….he is here;
Her eyes are opened, it is he!
Now night and day he will appear
In dreams, that fevered, solitary,
Speak of him, and endlessly
All things declare, and magically,
His presence: kindness is vexation,
The servant’s looks pure irritation.
Lost in her deep melancholy,
She pays no attention to their guests
Curses their hours of idleness,
Their visits an unwelcome folly,
Hates the tedium of their visit,
Their tendency to sit, and sit. 
A sprinkling of commonsense,
Now with greater concentration,
She reads the sweet romances,
Finds a deeper fascination,
In those soft seductive glances!
Each figment of imagination,
Every writer’s fine creation,
Cottin’s Malek-Adhel, de Krudener’s de Linar,
The lover too of Rousseau’s Julie Womar,
Werther, born to be a martyr,
And the peerless Grandison,
Who sends me to sleep, all were as one;
A swarm of beauties, cool betrayers;
The foolish dreamer sees them whole
In Onegin’s form, and soul.  
A table’s readied for the pair;
And sees herself the heroine
Of all the authors she admires,
Clarissa, Julie, or Delphine;
Wanders among forest choirs
With some dangerous volume roams,
Through its pages swiftly combs,
To find her passion, and her dream,
Her overflowing heart, love’s gleam.
She sighs and in herself possesses
Another’s joy, another’s sorrow,
A tedious season we await,
In her mind she writes, addresses.
Yet ours, though he may be one,
Is certainly no Grandison. 
A tenderness. Whether he meant
In the high style of the past,
An author of romantic fiction
Had to present his hero as
A thing the winter cannot tame;
Always unjustly persecuted,
His character was executed
To show intelligence and grace,
A time when, pursued by spleen
His heart forever burned with rapture, 
Pure devotion his desire,
Prepared for sacrificial fire:
And always, in the final chapter,
Vice was ruthlessly put down,
While virtue won a noble crown.
A tomb, a Cyprian shrine to love,
But now our minds are somewhat cloudy,
Morals makes us nod, not sins;
Even in books, virtue’s dowdy, 
And even there, at last, vice wins. 
All the British Muse’s lumber
Now disturbs a young girl’s slumber,
Her idol, someone to admire,
Is the blood-sucking Vampire,
Melmoth, Maturin’s traveller,
The Corsair or the Wandering Jew, 
Nodier’s Jean Sbogar too.
Lord Byron with a shrewd despair,
Displays a hopeless egotism
As saturnine romanticism. 
A trouble-maker, and malicious;
My friends, where’s the sense in it?
Perhaps by some divine decree,
A true Childe Harold, my Onegin
Self, and end my poetry.
Defying then the dread Apollo,
The paths of humble prose I’ll follow
Write novels in established ways
To fill up my declining days.
No fear and menace in my tale,
No villain’s hidden agony,
A victim, decked out for the gale… 
With that my readers I’ll regale, 
Love’s enchantments: and my verse
Our ancient customs shall rehearse. 
A village, a house among the trees,
I’ll record the honest speech
Of an old uncle, or some father’s,
Then by the stream, beneath the beech
The breathless meeting of young lovers;
Fierce jealousy, sad separation,
Tears of reconciliation,
A vital force flows from the root,
Then to the altar, by and by…. 
I’ll recall the words of longing,
Uttered in those days of bliss,
In a time far, far from this,
At my mistress’s feet lying,
Words that flowed from my tongue,
Lost now that power of being young.
A walk indeed would suit me best,
Tatyana, my dear Tatyana!
I share those tears that agitate:
To the hands of fashion’s monster,
You now consign your fate.
My dear one you’re doomed to perish,
But first what hopes you’ll cherish,
Blinded, dazed by sombre joys,
You’ll drink the poison love employs,
You’ll learn its bliss, its desires,
While such dreams pursue you,
Thinking every place you view
To shelter lovers’ trysts aspires;
While fated everywhere to find,
Your true seducer in your mind. 
A wandering pedlar had brought
Haunted by love’s pain, Tatyana,
Takes to the garden, walking
Eyes downcast, till her languor,
Prevents her from even moving.
Her breast heaves, her cheeks aflame,
Burning suddenly with shame,
The breath on her lips is glazed,
A whiteness covering the ground:
Night falls, and the moon patrols
The vault of heaven. Near her room,
A windmill dances a wild jig,
Its rich sonorous cadence rolls. 
Tatyana, in the darkness lying, 
To her nurse is softly sighing.
A wintry carpet deep and light,
A wreath once swayed to and fro.
Open the window then sit by me.’
Abandoned for barbaric tongues,
Nurse, I’m bored, tell me a story.’
Abandoned, the fields are silent,
I knew scores and scores, in rhyme,
Old tales they were, fables laden
With Evil spirits, a lovely maiden;
Tanya, it’s gone, my memory,
All that I knew forgotten. Yes,
Time’s done it’s work, I must confess,
I’m muddled now!’… ‘But Nurse, tell me,
When you were young, long ago,
Were you in love? I must know!’
Abandoning all true discretion,
Abodes of demons and of monsters;
We’d never heard the word. One sigh
And my mother-in-law, bless her ways,
Would chase me about, fit to die.’
Then how did you come to wed?’ ‘Tanya,
It was God’s will now, my Vanya,
Was just a lad, if you could have seen
Us then, and I, I was just thirteen. 
The matchmaker spent two weeks trying
To persuade my parents, no less,
Then father blessed me, and said yes.
Oh, you should have heard me crying,
Still wept as they unwound my hair,
And sang me to church. What a pair!’
Finds delight to come, or doom;
My husband’s folk…do you hear?’
Then from a dish, rings are taken,
About the weather, crops, and cattle…’ 
It seems to me I’m ill, my dear,
I long to sob, I long to weep…!’
About time too! (I hear you say?)
Oh Lord! What can I get you, daughter…
Let me sprinkle you, fetch holy water,
You’re in a fever…’ ‘No, I’m not ill:
I’m…Nurse, you see…I’m in love.’
Above ‘t(out) à v(ous), Annette’;
May the Good Lord preserve us still!’ –
The sign of the cross she made
Over the girl, and trembling prayed.
In a soft whisper, gives a moan.
Told in winter, late at night.
Were what gave her most delight,
Absorbed by remorse at things done
The nurse. ‘It’s love. Leave me alone.’
Meanwhile, the sad moon dreams,
On the girl’s pale beauty gleams,
Shines above, its tranquil light
Silvering loosened hair, tears bright,
The bench beside her, where the nurse
In kerchief and quilted gown,
By our heroine sits, spell-bound.
And all the world lies still, below,
Bathed in the moon’s enchanted glow.
Accounts, drink, rage, the gloomy evening,
Tanya watches the moon’s sphere, 
Her soul in distant regions wanders,
And then, a sudden thought shines clear:
Achieved in her conceited look,
Achieving peace at last, and plenty;
That table nearer; I’ll be sure
To sleep later. Now goodnight.’
Alone, in silence. The moon sheds light.
Propped on her elbow, now she pens,
Thinking of Eugene, all the while,
Across a gentlemanly space,
That breathes a young girl’s innocence.
The letter’s done, is folded, sealed…
Tatyana! Whose name is revealed?
Adding to albums of that kind,
I’ve known women, proud and cold,
As pure as winter’s ice, as rigid,
Unfathomable, even to the bold,
As stern, as distant, and as frigid.
I marvelled at their arrogance,
Iron virtue, chilly glance,
To keep well clear of them, I vow,
And that inscription on their brow,
The one on Hades’ Gate: Surrender
All hope, all you who enter here.’
What consoles them is our fear,
They abhor it when we’re tender.
Perhaps you’ve seen, on Neva’s shore,
The like of them, one or more.
Administering the same corrections
And I’ve seen other beauties too
Ringed by loyal devotees,
Indifferent to me or you,
To sighs, or praise, or flatteries. 
And yet I was amazed to find
Them often feign a change of mind,
Frightening a timid love away
Reviving it the following day:
At least a pretence of empathy,
At least their words seeming more,
Kind and tender than before.
So the gullible would blindly,
Young and fond, pursue again,
That fatal sweetness, though in vain.
Adorns the table, boiling hot,
Why then consider Tanya guilty?
Because her simplicity, it seems,
Is ignorant of deceit, and still she
Believes completely in her dreams?
Or because her love lacks art,
Follows the promptings of her heart?
Because she’s trusting, and honest
And by Heaven has been blessed,
With profound imagination,
Ah, now but you’re up already!
All those foreign words and phrases.
Although we welcome you, so gladly.
Surely, then, you can forgive,
Among sad cliffs for preference.
An Academician in a bonnet!
Tatyana is no cool coquette, 
She loves in all seriousness,
Yields to it like a child, as yet
Full of innocence and sweetness.   
She’d never argue: Let’s delay
Increase love’s value, find a way
To mesh him deeper in our net.
First rouse his vanity and let
Him hope, deploy uncertainty,
Exhaust him, now, let him doubt,
Till the flame is dying out;
Then calmly stir his jealousy,
Lest tired of pleasure, freedom won,
He ends the struggle and has done. 
And so she wrote in French of course …
Now, I’m in some difficulty,
Since, to preserve my reputation,
I must give her letter, error-free,
In Russian, honouring our nation. 
But Tanya wrote it all so badly,
Never read Russian papers, sadly, 
Had never, even when young,
Been fluent in her native tongue. 
Has never with letters been allied. 
What’s to be done? As we all know,
No lady’s ever deigned to show
Her love thus, since, despite its force,
Our great language, in its pride,
Sinks to rest…
And as a rule despised each face,
I know: they’d like to force our girls
To read in Russian. Ah, what horror!
Could you conceive those golden curls,
Izmailov’s Journal set before her!
Is it not true, my fellow poet,
Those dear creatures, oh, you know it,
For whom, to expiate our crimes,
We wrote all those secret rhymes,
To whom our hearts were consecrated,
Didn’t they mutilate our speech,
Our Russian language, and yet each
Fault was charming, though it grated?
And ask your Muse to take a bow,
Habitually, between their lips.
And draw to us a handsome lad,
May I never meet, at a ball,
By the entrance step, or on it,
And he must never mention me…’ –
And never breathe a word of it,
Like rose-red lips without a smile,
Russian without such faults is vile,
Lacks charm. The new generation,
Of beauties, with the press’s clamour,
May yet accustom us to grammar,
Make poetry their occupation;
As for me….they’re not my ways,
My heart is with the good old days.
And never fully plumb its measure.
Their incorrect and careless chatter,
Their errors of pronunciation,
Still add emotion to the matter,
Stir the same old sweet sensation.
I’ve not the strength for repentance,
French still entrances in a sentence,
Like the sins that youth rehearses,
Or Bogdanóvich’s light verses.
Enough. It’s time for that letter,
Written by my pure young beauty,
I gave my word, and it’s my duty,
Though blank pages would be better;
We’ve no use for Parny’s rhymes
In these far less tender times. 
And not abandon me to fate. 
Singer of Feasts and melancholy,
Baratynsky, were you with me now,
I might commit a daring folly
And now, at this very moment,
Borrow your bewitching skill,
Translate my Tanya, with a will,
Into verse that would amaze us,
And on the rustic bench’s gleam
Where are you, now? It’s your right,
I cede my own in deference…..
But no, beneath Finland’s skies,
Far now from praise, he sighs,
And rose from the bench again,
In spirit, he abandons me
To all my plaintive misery.
And the flame in her cheek.
Tayana’s letter’s here before me,
I treat it as a sacred treasure,
Read it secretively, sadly,
And then, while you were gone,
Who inspired such tenderness,
Surrender’s language, rare excess?
Who taught her this intense emotion,
This heartfelt speech, gave the notion,
So charming and so perilous?
I know not, yet here’s my translation,
Pale, incomplete, an imitation,
Of a living work, as dubious
As an air from Weber’s Freischütz played,
By nervous hands, mind half-obeyed. 
TATYANA’S LETTER TO ONEGIN
And we….don’t shine in any way,
How shall I add to my confession?
I know it’s in your power today
To punish me with your derision.
Yet had compassion a part to play
In your thoughts, you would wait,
Another day, and still no sign,
At first I wished to stay quite silent,
Thus, you never would have heard 
Of shame or misery, one word.
If I’d reserved a hope, content
To see you but once a week,
Be in your presence, hear you speak,
Utter a few words of greeting,
Another? ....No, no there’s none
Have that to think, and think, upon,
Day and night, till our next meeting.
You’re unsociable, they say
That the country bores you, sadly;
Are only instruments and tools;
Are you then my guardian angel,
Why did you come, to disturb us?
Lost in our rural solitude?
I’d not have known you, and thus
Been spared this deep inquietude,
In time (who knows?) I might have viewed
My world with equanimity, 
This fever born of youth once past,
Found another, served at last,
As wife and mother, faithfully. 
As yet unknown, I held you dear,
On earth but you my heart adores!
That was ordained by fate, alone…
It’s Heaven’s will: I am yours. 
My life was but a pledge till now
Of our prophetic meeting: yes,
God sent you to me, I avow,
Till in the grave we shall rest…
You appeared to me in dreams,
My soul heard your voice ring clear,
Boldly trusting in your honour…’
Stirred by a stranger’s glance, it seems,
Long ago….It was no phantom!
You appeared, and instantly,
My hearts ablaze, I cried: ‘It’s he’,
In my thoughts, I was struck dumb.
Is it not true? I often heard you:
In quiet, did you not speak to me,
In works of charity, all through
The hours of anguished prayer I knew, 
When my head ached so painfully?
Bringing breakfast on a tray,
Is it not you, this heaven-sent
Vision, standing by my bed,
Deep, in the translucent night
To bring, with love and solace bright,
Fresh hope on which my heart is fed?
Conceive it. No one here to cherish
Or my tempter, force of evil:
Dispel my doubts, I am blind,
Perhaps this is all vanity,
The fancies of a foolish mind,
Mine another destiny….
So be it! My fate now lies
In your hands, my direction,
The tears flow from my eyes,
I beseech your protection…
Enters softly and disturbs her,
Me, or understand my moan,
My mind in torment, I’m alone:
Silently, I’m doomed to perish.
I await you: one look turned
Towards me, wake hope in my heart,
Or make this painful dream depart
Speak the reproach I have earned!
I tremble to re-read….must end!
My heart sinks now, in shame and terror…
On you alone I must depend
Her head sinks, the stars grow older,
Her night-dress slips from her shoulder, 
Tatyana moans then gives a sigh,
The letter trembles in her hand;
The wafer meant to seal it’s dry,
Still quivering there on her tongue.
Is turned to silver. From it’s dream,
Onegin’s friendship, so they met.
Soon the dawn will bring new light,
The moon no longer shines as bright,
The radiance dies: there the vale
Shines with mist. Here a stream
Wished sincerely to acquire
He wakes at noon, or even later,
Morning comes: the dark is done,
To my Tatyana, all is one. 
Like stone and water, ice and flame,
She barely notices the dawn,
Sits with head downcast, still holds
The seal with her monogram,
Poised above the letter’s folds.
The nurse, old Filipevna, 
No two men were less the same
His life till dawn the same as ever,
Are you as you were? Have new
I see your fretting’s left no trace,
See, my early bird, my darling,
Save us, how well you’re looking!
Last night what a fright you gave me!
Red as a poppy, your bright face.’
The millions of two-legged creatures
As at the feast he seemed to be?
As lightning in his visage plays.
Asks Larina, curious,
My sweet child, as God is holy.’
No suspicions… nurse, obey.’ –
Perhaps the mail’s caused some delay,’
At first they seemed indifferent
Must take this letter, secretly, to O…
To our neighbour… he, you know,
At last she gave a sudden sigh,
At nothing, pathway, lake, or copse,
Breaks the lilacs, hurrying on,
I know I’m slow, and short of wit,
But we’ve so many neighbours, why
I can’t count them if I try.’
Breathing on the icy pane,
But scarcely comprehends their art,
But still the pounding in her ears,
Old, Tanya, and my mind…God bless,
Once master had no need to scold,
When I was young, a mere suggestion…’
But the end to this encounter,
What has all that to do with me,
This letter here, don’t you see,
It’s for Onegin.’ – ‘Yes, indeed,
Don’t be cross with me, my sweet,
My mind….But you’re pale as a sheet:
Child, is there something you need?’
Dressed at dawn, she gives a sigh,
Go now, take this note of mine.’ –
Dusk falls, the samovar is gleaming
The day slips past, with no reply,
They were one instead of two.
Until, such good friends were they
But was dear Yevgeny content
Then Olga’s suitor, Lensky’s here:
By slyly thieving one or two;
By some careless lad for sport,
Come away, my pretty ones,
Come you maidens, pretty maidens,
Make friends, from sheer idleness.
Olga’s there, and quietly fills
The shining tea-cups, never spills
So people (I openly confess)
Free, and in the flower of youth, 
Do I hear once more your choir sing?
Eavesdropper, don’t you dare
It glows and hisses, softly steaming,
Oh God, what must he think of me?’
Vapour wreathes the china pot.
Some he liked and placed apart,
Yet (as all rules exceptions boast)
Exhausted by society,
His gaze inspired: how he could preach! –
Tatyana hovers at the window,
Preventing them from doing wrong!)
THE GIRLS’ SONG
His mind, still malleable the while, 
Faithlessness was not amusing
Far off a choir of girls sing
On the misted glass, a shadow,
She’s lost in thought now, once again;
Friendship like that’s to us unknown,
From porch to yard, in a moment,
Her heart still, in it’s agony,
Her heartache feels like some disease,
Tatyana flies, as swift as faith,
Her little finger’s traced, I see,
Not looking backward for an instant,
Past the flowers, down the lawn,
Past the bridge, and pond, she stops,
Tanya was blushing, trembling.
Prose and poetry, in intent.
Through the borders, gains the stream,
Monotonous and varied, say,
She heard our Lensky answering;
She trembles, burning, in fear:
Still bears a hope, a dream darkly.
Tanya downcast, as if she heard,
They rode together every day,
To each other, but liking grew,
Tomorrow just like yesterday.
Idols replaced you, a worse choice?
Midst glittering victories, in truth,
The sacred letters, O and E. 
Our minds are full of prejudice,
We think the others noughts, alone
Midst oft repeated amusement?
Of how it lives, the what and why
See a Russian Terpsichore wing
With staple products its supply,
First Madame, you understand,
Foot it sweetly, now and neatly,
Foot it sweetly, on the grass!
Frantic and quivering, caught
Glimpsing from the distant field
Sing a song, unbind your hair,
It’s clear they’re not eating them,
Let’s surround him, in a trice,
To our dance, to our choir.
When we see him, when he’s near us,
When we see our lad approach,
Not daring to stop, for then
Pelt him, with ripe red cherries,
Raspberries, sweet redcurrants:
He heard our Lensky with a smile,
Listen to our secret song,
Never spy on what we do,
What we sing’s not meant for you!
Her eyes are clouded, filled with tears,
Tatyana hears their distant choir,
Her. Galloping, closer it appears.
Waiting there, her cheeks on fire, 
Tries to calm her beating heart,
Or a hare trembles, hapless thing,
Still the throbbing is fierce,
So a poor butterfly will seek
The sound of hooves! ...Sent to freeze
To beat once more its rainbow wing,
Ourselves the integer in this.
We all possess Napoleon’s features;
Was he as vigorous and carefree 
Her way again in soulful flight?
The huntsman by the hedge, concealed. 
Is this him, now? She cannot hear.
It is Yevgeny,’ sees him plain,
Turned, and saw before her: ‘Why,
Valued feelings, with empty heart.
Not for long were lovely ladies
Standing there, his eyes ablaze,
On any fond face on this stage,
She halts, as if scorched by flame,
Rooted to the ground, in shame.
The poet’s bold impassioned speech,
The object of his constancy;
Turning on the alien mass
Left his father, stunned by theory,
Though he knew the human race,
No, for his early feelings faded,
Or must my dull gaze fail to light
No need to keep reserves of gold.
Then Monsieur taught the child
Admire it, as if he were trying.
Admire the dense and noisy hum,
Advice both sensible and sound.
The easier she is to win,
After such unremitting labour, 
Against intruders; furiously,
Age demands prose for a time,
Age drives away the urchin, rhyme.
Agitates the candle-flames;
Ah well, to them may God be kind! 
Ah, but then the whirl of fashion,
Ah, friends! How often joyous, too,
Ah, what treasures Fate has taken!
Alas it’s sad to think that youth
Alas! Her friend of many a day,
Alas! Her look seems to hold
Alas! Young girls are faithless ever,
Alas, excessive) and the wine,
Alas, not difficult to guess!
Alas, now some are distant,
Her work the crackling firewood lights,
Indoors the maid will softly croon
To the spinning-wheel’s low rattle,
Pinched her waist with tight laces,
The faithful friend of wintry nights.
Used the nasal ‘n’ in places
Albion’s proud lyre I follow,
All around her, glittering white. 
Childhood mischief, petty glories
Were not her forte; horror stories
Bitten by the snake, Memory,
But even in her earliest days
Such were my Yevgeny’s thoughts.
For he was victim from his youth
Deceived – a welcome rest would take. 
Distanced from the claims of beauty,
Eight years he killed, hour by hour,
News from town, the latest craze,
She never chose to rehearse.
Enchantment fails such men as he,
Hearing in the crowd, and after,
In the sound, and silence cold,
That sad protest in his soul, 
Stifling a yawn with laughter:
He followed still, for customs sake.
Squandered youth, life’s finest flower.
He sought them without joy, and met
Refused – found consolation swiftly,
Tatyana had no doll to nurse,
The pain of time lost, past recall:
The coachmen by the fire free
Their absent masters to berate. 
All attentive, or just mumble! 
All he sees and hears, he notes;
Enriched by meditative dream.
Timidly, once in a while,
Her tender fingers never held
All mankind’s malicious ways
To bee and butterfly unknown. 
All serious effort – no words flow,
His first pipings were of her,
In him the poet’s exaltation,
Yet now, receiving Tanya’s note,
Onegin’s heart was deeply moved;
Failed to join the shameless guild,
Olga was the first to stir
He yawned inordinately, and so
Fill him with dissatisfaction,
Humbly living out existence,
Tried to write, it makes him ill 
Sees it all; the fashions, faces, 
And, exiled for that very thing
Our wanderings and again
To which we dedicated then
As emptiness possessed his soul,
He sought the forest’s shadowy ways,
Oh, farewell now, the golden days!
Thoughts of her his inspiration.
Of Writers: whom I cannot blame
Solitude, silence, dark of night,
Since, I’m one too and just the same. 
Bows to friends, then views the action,
Turns on the stage indifferent eyes,
Plus another hidden reason,
Then off to ramble in the park.
All night, barely a foot away!
All of that ancient rhetoric,
All such is alien to my mind;
All that you sincerely meant
All the shades of wintry pleasure;
All the trouble, and the pain,
All those torments that oppress,
Alone, engrossed in calculation;
My life with the domestic round;
Are subject to infatuations,
Find that youthful folly real,
My being in family existence 
For but a moment, mind and sense –
Then truly, in this life,
You alone would be my wife.
No rhetoric, no flattery,
I’d find in you my heart’s ideal,
Love is a mere game of Satan’s.   
Although inseparable I’ve found
Always faithful to the end,
Always together, in her room
Am I unworthy, you would find.
An ironic stanza of how he’s smitten.
And argue whether it shows wit.
And be as happy…as I could!
And calms his fears with a kiss,
Believe me (conscience is my guide)
Wed, the fire would soon have died;
However I wished to prove true,
Habit would cool my love for you.
Then you would weep, yet your tears,
Your grief, would never move my heart,
But madden me, spur me to depart.
What thorns, not roses, through the years
Would Hymen strew along our way,
Many a night, and many a day?
And cloistered life Onegin led.
What in the world is worse than this,
And fled through the fields, that too
Mourning her husband’s absent kiss,
Her days and nights alone, through life,
While the spouse, knowing her worth,
And her youthful charms, elated,
Is ever-jealous, sullen, sour,
Cold, darkly threatening, and dour!
Such am I. Was it this you sought,
With your pure and ardent mind;
Was this what you hoped to find;
This the message your note brought?
Is this the destiny that waits,
Dealt you by the cruel Fates?
And hurriedly, before it died,
His days and dreams, what man recovers?
My soul, nothing can renew….
My love for you is as a brother’s,
More tender even, but as true:
So hear me without tears or anger,
And then…our hearts we must restrain,
Fresh dreams will replace the last,
As, after winter’s icy blast,
Spring clothes the branches with new leaves,
As heaven dictates. You’ll love again.
Blind with that mist that veils the eye. 
Not all will see what your soul weaves,
Know you as I, share your belief:
The inexperienced come to grief.
He gave his arm: downcast, head bent,
So Eugene preached, as she listened;
She scarcely breathed; made no reply;
Saw nothing through the tears that glistened,
Sleeps soundly, passes thus his days,
Upon it, sadly, Tanya leant,
With not a thought in the morning
And in his hut, with a will,
And slowly they both made their way
Homeward, through the kitchen-garden;
Entered, together, arm in arm,
No one finding any harm
In that, for rustic life to pardon.
There such freedoms are allowed,
As much as in Moscow, the proud.
And in the bath-house, in a trice
Surely, my Reader, you’d agree
Our friend behaved well, in his way,
Dealt with her sympathetically;
Not for the first time, made display
Of nobility of soul; yet spite
Never placed him in the right,
Castigated ruthlessly
By both friend and enemy, 
Are all your relations well?
Who showed him ambiguous respect.
From foes we can ourselves protect:
But from our friends, may God preserve us!
Oh! Those friends, those friends, so dear,
Not without cause I hail them here.
At least, denoting our regard,
What of it? Well, my true intention 
Is still to lull dark thoughts to sleep.
But in parentheses I’ll mention,
That there’s no infamy so deep,
Born, in a garret, of a liar
Nurtured by the mob, no dire
Epigram in all its coarseness,
No absurdity, no foulness,
That a friend would not repeat,
In decent company, and smile,
Without a hint of hate or guile,
Ten times, and never miss a beat;
Yet he is yours, through thick and thin,
He loves you….like your dearest kin!
H’m! My valued Reader, tell me,
Token of every beauty, good,
Ever desire’s habitual stream,
You might enjoy it, so allow me,
For your enlightenment, to spell
Out clearly what relation means.
Relations then are those, it seems,
Whom we are obliged to cherish,
Show respect to, love, and relish
Visits to at Christmas-tide,
Or to whom we send a card,
Ever habitual pain and grief,
Then, the year through, we can hide,
Our face will never cross their mind…
More sure than that of friends or kin,
Of course, a tender beauty’s love,
Their very presence causes spleen.
Vast applause. Onegin enters,
You may trust through storms above,
Whatever trouble you are in.
And kept dull boredom far away –
And the waywardness of passion,
Opinions they express in town…
The gentle sex is light as down.
Though you’re a spouse respected,
In every vicissitude of life,
By your good and virtuous wife,
Yet the most loyal, it’s expected,
And life’s horizons broad as yet,
And life a transient mystery:
And lost in misty moonlight all
At the same hour’s sweet caress,
On whom alone shall we depend?
Who will fit their speech and action,
To our measure, in the end?
Who will refrain from slander,
But, the outcome of their meeting?
Never pursue a phantom,
Who is never bored by us?
Though she requires a madrigal!
By candle-light she’d rise and dress. 
From the first she craved romances,
Her great delight, she loved them so,
Stirs the breeze, brings on the morn,
While, herald of the morning, lightly
His epigrams topped up with bile. 
Still hold half the world in thrall,
How often, on a summer’s night,
That dressing room, all solitary,
How passionate his eloquence,
The East is indolently white,
The sky aglow above the Neva,
Shall I depict with faithful pen
Where no face showed of Diana
With that pale diaphanous light,
Where fashion’s loyal devotee 
How swift his letters from the heart!
And my Eugene was free at last,
And on the first page, for inspection:
And portrayed love’s happiness,
And praised to the skies above,
And recreate the magic hoard,
And scratch her neck, and stubbornly
And sets her down upon the floor.
And stranger still, behold a spider
And the crowd, all the rabble…’
And then? Full of confusion,
And there you’ll see, without a doubt,
Applies himself with diligent
As a storm will often shroud
As in the olden days they flowed,
As they composed them long ago…’
Love yourself, your only care,
Or waste your efforts on the air
Enlightenment has been a waste
Estimable Reader: come,
Hour by hour, by Olga’s beauty
No more deserving lover,
In our regard, has left us blessed
At that time, and retired from view,
Attention to her album: find,
Be amused by our vices;
Beside which Chateaubriand’s pale,
Better than one dour modern lyric?’ –
Encouraged by his Olga’s smile,
Enough. It’s high time that instead,
He’d dare to toy with a tress,
Modest, tender, sweet illusion,
I painted over this sad scene, 
Or kiss the hem of her dress.
Nature passages of a power
Though, dear Reader, I confess
To delight in childish play, 
With the others, sweetly dancing.
Both had known the play of passion
Skipping over certain pages,
Forgive me: I’ve loved from the start
I’m overcome, by pity I mean;
But often to the window glued
My Tatyana, with all my heart.
She’d sit all day in solitude.
Both had wearied of the game, 
But hush! You hear? Our sternest critic
But you, the suspect volumes bound,
By Fyodor Tolstoy, decorated
Or more fitting, you’ll discover.
By affectation – not the rest. 
By critics of the higher arts,
Commands us to reject for good,
From passing thought, enduring rhyme,
Within, a rural landscape painted,
One with which she’s acquainted,
He leaves a tender verse behind,
Perched on a lyre a little dove,
Lightly sketched, with wash and ink,
Or on a page some other’s signed,
Health, life’s beauty, sweetness past,
His dream’s mute monument, a link
Her smile, her calm serenity, 
That stands impervious to time. 
Such albums of provincial girls,
You’ll often have seen, of course,
The dawning day in sombre cloud. 
Which their friends will all endorse
Like a doe seen in a clearing,
Like lost fading echoes flee, 
Poor Tanya’s youth fading fast:
Melancholy, wild, retiring,
His unique eccentricity,
Poor Tatyana was on fire,
Sleep deserted her entire.
Lacking rosy cheeks, the manner,
To attract a passing lover.
Liked his dreamy tendency, 
Doze on the fur coats in the lobby,
Grateful, in my heart of hearts,
I must confess I scarcely mind
Two hearts, some flowers, a torch assure,
Love’s violent pains, heart’s beating,
Some army type too will have written,
The soul, wreathed in its sadness;
Worse, with a joyless madness
Not a beauty like her sister,
So, she is called Tatyana.
I liked his face, his manner too,
The eager nonsense I may pen
Will not be picked apart again,
I made a friend of Eugene then.
Who’ll solemnly consider it,
While weary servants half-awake,
Conceal his hopes, feign jealousy,
Cries: ‘Cease your endless squawking,
To torment fashionable rhymesters,
In secret regions underground,
Enough, it’s all the same, you know,
You handsome albums, illustrated
Enough, it’s time now to move on!’
With lines by Baratynsky too,
May Heaven’s lightning wither you!
When a fashionable lady
Offers me her own, in quarto,
The rage and spite she cannot know,
That stirs dark epigrams within me,
Prompting something steeped in gall,
Tatyana’s bloom is all but gone,
Fleeing at the sign of danger,
No madrigals from Lensky flow
Into Olga’s album here,
His lines breathe love alone, and no
Sparkles of icy wit appear.
To Olga, his hours he devotes;
Full of life’s sincerest passions,
God knows whom and what; your art,
His tributes, carefully, he fashions.
So Yazykov, when you’re inspired
Singing, from your burning heart
Tell the story of your fate.
The noble elegies you’ve sired,
Will at some far distant date,
Whom to love, whom to believe in,
From memories of long ago,
He drew a mourning veil of black.
The wretched wreath of elegy (sic),
To our poetic brotherhood,
Who support us when we wander,
In the names that we rehearse 
This perpetual sterile talking,
Lamenting what is done and gone;
I too cast off the social burden,
Must write true odes, odes gentlemen,
The classic mask, the trumpet, sword,
That’s it, my friend?’ – ‘No! Your pen,
Through our work, of lost genius:
Then come Cupid, imp and snake,
Treading the boards interminably,
From the first, he’d spread confusion,
Neighbours shook their heads, forever
Sighing: ‘It’s high time she was wed!’…
Her father, mother, not her way
In his deft satire: Is all you’ve read
Remember what Dimitriev said
Nothing can provide distraction,
She, more pallid, and more silent! 
To her family a stranger.
His mind, incisive, and chilly;
Or stir her soul, no incitement.
Whispering solemnly together,
She never took to caressing
I was bitter, he was gloomy. 
Sniffing, coughing, hissing, clapping.
The audience, their feet still tapping,
Gain trust, or cause pure disillusion,
Is there a poet who rehearses
What odes might Vladimir have written,
Which Olga never would have read.
Now, when Eugene reached the age
Of restless youth’s tumultuous passion,
And the hypocrisy, demeaning,
And then Onegin approached her,
And then he’ll dress, may write a letter, a
And then one wet shoe disappears
And then, if suddenly she spied
And tiresome pleasures full of strife.
And waking early, Tanya found,
And when a meteor crossed the sky,
I read to my old nurse, who’ll lend
The fruits of my own meditation,
Ill-rhymed verse, by tradition,
With friendship’s and wisdom’s pearls,
And when nurse had collected
And, there? .....Around a table sit
Anywhere, start, end, or middle,
Around the hour the French name
But we must to the garden go,
Where Tanya met him, as we know.
As a veteran, solemn faced,
As being entre chien et loup,’
As for Tanya this one chimes:
As to where he’ll spend his evening.  
At home all day, more or less,
But, what of Onegin? True, dear Reader!
Lines too short, long, or a riddle,
At tag in the meadows, say,
At the moon’s meaning, each chill phase;
Aunts and mothers keeping house,
Before I meditate the rest. 
Beguiles, with its seductive lies.
Behind a door cheers resound,
To the stream below the hill.
Like Byron, who of Gulnare sings,
He swims that little Hellespont,
Beside the fire a table’s laid,
Of wisdom, then for coffee rings,
It brought to life, instantly, 
Second stroll, and then et cetera… 
Those feelings, so long quiescent;
His youthful love, warm and tender,
Shadowy woods and crystal brook,
That’s no ready compliment,
The heart alive with kiss and look;
Swiftly apprising Yevgeny
Besides they are so pure, so pious,
Besides, my friend, you’re invited,
Peace and quiet – such the fine
Ceased to count the summer days,
He gently yielded to its ways,
Forgetting friends and city life,
Gave himself to it instead,
The simple girlish way she loved.
The tender style in which she wrote,
Besides, the enthusiasm of youth
But summer in our northern clime,
Bits of Northern poetry
Flashes by, and in no time
Though we’d deny its flight, is over. 
The sky with autumn’s breath is clouded, 
Blessed, the man who lives a fiction,
Bordeaux, I tell the waiter:
How love to the tomb will endure;
With many a solemn vow round about,
On her balcony, alone,
But later found it re-assuring,
Dawn breaks in a chilly gloom,
On the next page let them write.’
While the last has this reflection:
Their laughter noisy, tedious,
Their raucous games so frivolous.
I thought Onegin’s talk disturbing
Borne away to change at home. 
Side by side, in the gloom,
From the cradle, the slow stream
Or in the garden, in the dawn,
They’d stroll about on the lawn.
Of placid dull rusticity
Both had known Fate’s passing fashion,
Bottles of Cliquot or Moët,
Bringing the science of persuasion
Deceit, and slander, rings and tears,
Threats, entreaties, vows and fears,
Finding all jealousy absurd –
Who is not bored with evasion,
Happier he who never knew them,
Letters running to six pages,
The heavy friendship of a spouse?
To keep from the gambling table.
Whose capital he’s proved able
He’d wander through a drawing room,
To prejudices rarely seen
He who yawns away his life
Hearing the same outworn objections,
In little girls of scarce thirteen?
Who’s not exhausted by their rages,
With his relations and his wife,
Like Childe Harold, mournful, dour,
Soars, glistening half-ethereal,
Tired of repeating platitudes,
To bear on things we’ve all eschewed,
What can one do in such a season?
Who has cooled love’s agitation
To blow his brains out, as we’re told,
With parting, vengeance with a word,
Yet his life grew sad and cold. 
The rustling curtain as we breathe
But as for genius, if any,
But hear my confession through,
In seduction’s net of sin. 
The easier to snare and ruin,
But most of all they talked of passions,
But not without a blush, I fear.
Tatyana such things rejected;
Lends it charm, intense delight.
Olga’s little friends to play,
Though it adds to conversation,
Yields to pensive idleness, 
With icy baths his days begin,
But our Onegin’s off to roam,
But you, Bordeaux, are a friend
From dawn, his only occupation,
To strike a billiard-ball or two,
Not more, with an old blunt cue;
Then as the rural evening nears,
The cue’s abandoned, half-lights fade,
But, perhaps this winter scene
He waits then Lensky appears,
His three roans in a troika. Fine,
Now at last, it’s time to dine!
Captivated by its essence; 
Champagne is like a mistress,
The heavenly drink, you’d agree,
In chilled bottles, for the poet,
Reaches the table, speedily,
It sparkles, like the Hippocrene. 
Once, it’s golden bubbles seen,
Cheerfully, I’d give my all
Enchanted me: I often sat
How many follies in its presence,
In misfortune, and in sorrow,
To imbibe it, friends: recall?  
Some girl, delighted that he’s found her,
What laughter from enchanted streams,
Verses, quarrels: ah, what dreams!
Spoilt by each casual encounter,
Yet to my stomach it’s a traitor,
With its hissing, foaming ways;
Of rationality and peace,
That’s my favourite, nowadays.
Ready to serve, today, tomorrow,
Sparkling, lively, and capricious,
Wilful, wild, but empty too…
To Champagne I’m no longer true,
Then disenchantment, bored desire,
Yet bored again by conquest’s mire; 
When passions’ flames have wavered,
Cards, or glance, or sweet sigh’s power,
Joy of our hours of leisure, so
Here’s to my dear friend, Bordeaux! 
Chapter Five
The fire dies down; the ashes veil
The golden coals, a slender thread
Of smoke scarce visible, soft, pale,
Spirals upwards, overhead;
The hearth glows, pipe-smoke passes,
Up through the flue, sparkling glasses
On the table, bubble, hiss,
Then settle like the evening mist…
Charms us with sublime invention,
I love a friendly glass, the same,
Cold yawns with their icy train.
Our friends now are in its spell.
Though why, I can hardly tell.)
Though he’d no wish to betray
Considering himself, so placed,
Fine…They’re all well, and send you
Your Olga, how’s Tatyana too?’
Her face possessed his memory,
Her neck, her throat, her shoulder!
Their greetings, ah, what a beauty
Olga’s turned into, so lovely,
Her pallor, and her melancholy,  
What spirit too! Before we’re older,
You must go, they’d be delighted.
You visited them twice, and then
Never once called on them again: 
Could never yet conceal a thing,
Like the fool I am, I clean forgot!
You must go, no matter what.’ –
Drains his glass then, Heavens above,
Fine verses on his Finnish Maid.
Olga and her mother ask you,
To join them, it’s next Saturday,
There’s no reason for you not to.’ –
For two long minutes neither spoke,
Forgetting Hymen’s gifts, vexation,
Frosted glass; and far hills gleaming;
Who’ll be there? Just the family, 
Oblige me. Tell me that you’ll go.
What do you say?’ – ‘Alright!’ – ‘Bravo!’ –  
Toasting his fair neighbour, Lensky,
Garden, roofs, and fences, pale;
Talks of Olga: such is love!
He dreams of, in his exultation:
Lensky is overjoyed, elated,
His wedding two scant weeks ahead.
Love’s sweet crown so long awaited,
The secrets of the marriage bed,
Saying: ‘You wrote to me, I broke
He gave heart and soul expression,
Onegin heard the poet’s confession.
Generally their conversation
While we, of Hymen’s charms the foes,
Take domesticity to mean,
Scene after dull, exhausting scene,
Such stuff as Lafontaine’s suppose…
My poor Lensky, from the heart,
Was made for this very part.
Gentle Reader: low and mean,
He was loved…such his conviction,
Never doubting, lived in bliss.
Gives us the first snow’s measure,
He leaves again, and home has gone,
Rests, on the fantasy within,
Like a drunken traveller at an inn;
Or, less harshly, like a butterfly
Sipping the hour as it slips by;
Yet wretched the man who foresees all,
The sober-headed, for whom each
Motivation, action, speech,
Is hateful, in its essence, gall;
Whose heart, experienced, grown chill,
No longer forgets itself, at will.
He plunged, head first, into the stream,
Oh, be spared these fearful dreams,
Thou, my Svetlana.
Zhukovsky
He trots, performs amazing feats,
That year, the autumn lingered,
In yards and fields, loath to go.
Nature waited, icy-fingered
Winter stalled its fall of snow 
Till January the third, at night,
Silently: the dawn was bright,
Indifferently, the game is done,
The veteran is stirred, grows pale,
He would neglect and then abandon.
Magpies in the courtyard screaming;
Herself not certain of the reason)
Woods cloaked with a silver veil;
His fingers frostbitten of course,
His mare snorts at the snowy light,
In sheepskin coats with scarlet sash;
Winter! ...The peasant with delight
Makes a fresh road with his sleigh;
It’s fun, despite the pain he’s in, though
Steps delicately on her way;
The swift kibitkas’ runners trace
Powdery furrows as they race,
Their coachmen, seated, wield the lash
Love, or hate, it shouts the truth,
On his sledge the yard-boy seats
The best dog, Dasher: he’s the horse,
Mother scolds him from the window.
Nature’s vulgar, over-active.
Perhaps the ancient flame of passion,
Thrilled him in its former way,
Of every joy and suffering.
Talk of Bentham and of Say,
You may consider unattractive,
Off as if blown by Aeolus,
Prince Vyazemsky, Muse-inspired,
The crushing boredom of bon ton.
With purer inspiration fired,
Though it’s true some woman may
Takes a leap and, like down, sets
His labour, torment and delight,
The delights of frosty days,
Secret rendezvous in sleighs;
To challenge him I’ve no intention
Nor Baratynsky, who has made
So, for an evening game of whist,
Just as at wars of long ago
Tatyana (Russian through and through,
Loved Russia in the winter season;
Loved that cold perfection too,
Pink softness of its sunset glow.
The glittering frost on shiny days;
Sledge rides; and the far-off haze;
The gleaming radiance on snow,
Their loss, without pain or regret,
Their love, their hatred, went un-missed.
That even now can stir us so,
You were the first, capricious belles,
Istomina stands, serious
Promising, each year, again,
Listens to the young bloods still. 
Tanya believed in every tale,
Today we know, truth to tell
One foot planted, pirouettes
His springtime occupation bright,
Ducked the moralizing sermons,
Trembled at omens, anxiously;
From the stove on which it sat.
Her face grew pale, and she’d quiver.
Leaving a shining trail, she’d shiver,
Of follies fit to test the courts,
Of guests arriving brought the word,
The crescent moon, at her left side,
Unbridled passion was his truth.
When to the flag we have gathered
No gossip could dispel his gloom,
To the magic bow in thrall,
One thing alone he studied well,
Spared the lad from weary lessons,
Watching its flight with anxious eye,
But, God, what tedium to sample
Her secret wish to it confide. 
If she met, all unaware,
Christmas comes, joys unfold,
Crossed her path, in panicked flight,
Deep in thought, above the board,
Left her uncertain what to do…
In her confusion she’d take fright,
With sad expectancy would wait
For some malignant blow of fate. 
Even in the midst of terror.
Yet she found a secret charm,
For careless youth’s without regret,
Melds fascination with alarm) 
Over a game of chess they pored,
For social worlds beyond her years,
The fortunes of the young are told;
Its fate in death’s gaping portal,
Knowing all our joy is mortal,
While age, in spectacles, can see
Silent, leaning on an elbow,
Till Lensky, with abstracted look,
Repeating to it solemnly
Cannot but despise it all,
Chapter Four
Come in, warm yourself, my dear,
Considered as the art of love,
Could kindly fate for me prescribe
Covered by the powdery snow;
Cries, the clash of glasses, all
Lifted from the water, shaken,
Old monkeys of another age.
While the girls recite old rhymes,
We’ve toppled Lovelace as we ought,
Dispassionately gave a sigh;
Shovelling silver with a spade,
We sing those who, fortunes made,
Live in glory…ah, but sorrow
Is where that fair song is heading:
Girls prefer The Kitten’s Wedding.
Don’t disavow it, I find here,
Fit only for our grandsire’s stage,
The glittering stars, their endless trains,
For fortune-telling they prepare
From inside there’s noise and clatter;
From that dark forbidding face;
Gone, with the fashions we abuse,
Having escaped those stormy regions
That serious and heartless sport,
Onegin spoke of them with care,
Had gradually overwhelmed him,
Wigs and scarlet-heeled shoes. 
Happy the one who has passed by,
He offers her a long curved claw,
He pushes through the open door,
Or in some corner, an hour or so,
Prepares herself for protocol,
Unsuitable for girls to hear),
The child with her obedient doll,
He who’s lived, he who’s thought
I too recall….ah, not for me,
While Zhukovsky’s Svetlana
Instead we see, her sash untied,
This fortune-telling, I’ll let be. 
With his pawn took his own rook.
What mother preaches constantly.
He who feels, is quickly taught
Surrendered himself completely.
Her dearest friend was reverie,
Her handkerchief is next to go;
Sometimes he read to Olga, 
Her head above the silk inclined,
Here’s a hut, to which he dashes, 
His sharp claws, she lies inert,
How languid was his reticence,
I’ll leave the verdict up to you.’
I’ll requite, with your assent:
In both our hearts a dying flame,
In the morning of our days. 
Lanterns glitter far and wide,
Monsieur was packed off in brisk fashion,
No one is there, beyond its seething,
While both indoors and outside
Seem to pine, be sad or gloomy,
She sorrows at the dark divide;
The carriage horses, chilly, wait,
Their harness chafing, restlessly,
Sometimes proud, sometimes humble,
Those years of hope and tender rage,
To lead her to the other side;
Of cosseting one who’s half alive;
Rises from his hidden lair,
Tatyana screams! ...She hears a roar,
Puffing the pillows, you contrive
To help her cross, she gathers strength
The casual, the idealistic,
The fruit of carefree hours, unplanned,
I only wish the words I write
Ignore the tumult and the chatter’;
In his grasp, and barely breathing; 
She dare not stop, or look behind,
She quickens her despairing pace,
The seal, I have read your letter.
There’s no escape, in her sad mind,
Ingenuous, trusting, earnestly
La morale est dans la nature des choses.
Lack the strength just now to live it,
Lift her trailing hem, in flight;
Necker
Listening with tolerance,
Morality is in the nature of things.
Once cold-blooded lechery
Was praised, all that debauchery
My two youthful hermits there;
Or chondria, when we Russians speak, 
Pluck the gold earrings from her ears;
Thank God no desire claimed him,
Though they seemed devoid of sense. 
That spleen (so Englishmen are bitten)
The circle claps to make all happen, 
The orchestra, the stalls, they seethe,
Mastered I’ve no time to tell,
No time to retrieve it, in her fright,
Now along the track he crashes,
One window yields a rosy glow,
The creature once again is near;
She dare not, in her shame and fear,
She runs, he follows, on and on,
So unlooked-for, I’ll not give it,
Until her strength is all but gone.
Recited, as in reverie,
She falls to the snow, the bear alert
Rushes to lift her, swiftly sheathing
Yevgeny heard with condescension,
The cause of which it’s time to seek,
The sickness, with which he was smitten,
The theatre fills, the boxes glisten,
Trees crowd round; it’s drowned in snow,
The wealth of things my Yevgeny
Monsieur L’Abbé, French and thin,
The bear speaks: ‘Friends live here,
Let us all follow his example!
Of all that sentimental stew
Oh, he had loved as in our age
One a cockerel’s head; and see
One has a horned and doglike face;
She recovers, gazes round,
The bear has gone; she’s in a hall;
Seems half a heron, half a cat!
She finds a spy-hole in the door,
The clamour of a wake; unsure,
Sits a crayfish; wonderful,
So blameless in their intellect,
That to us is nothing new. 
So clever, and so circumspect,
Spins, beats one foot on the other.
Your candour: that is dear to me,
Telling the story of his ardour,
Though innocent tries one’s patience.
Twists her waist one way, another,
That occupied each night and day,
Taught him everything by whim,
That sitting by the bed all day,
These varied chapters in your hand,
With fond indulgence; witty, tragic,
Seeking the pleasure of my friends
Alexander Pushkin
Alight in his cold, torpid soul?
Alive again on memory’s stream.
All’s peaceful; in the parlour, vying
All are watching in surprise,
All evening Lensky was distracted,
The merry lads cut with their skates,
Toying happily with the Fates.
All forgotten, and rehearse
All glad at heart to take their rest,
All her daily walks grow longer,
All hope is lost! He leaves: a curse
All in good time, trust me, I’ll try
All rise; he rushes to the door. 
Among them all, confusion reigns,
And all their voices now combine
And curious as young girls are,
Pushes the door till it’s ajar…
But suddenly a draught of air
And bony finger, point her out;
Beard, tufted tail, sharp gleaming claw,
With glittering eyes Onegin there
Clatters his chair against the floor;
Eugene flings wide the door, reveals
Fang and tusk and blood-stained jaw,
Filled with terror, see her try
To flee the place; She cannot move,
The greater her attempts to fly,
The less of use her efforts prove.
For your pleasure, so be brave.
Her to that hellish crew – and peals
Of raucous laughter swell; all eyes,
Turn to her; and every guise,
Of horn and hoof and crooked snout,
Like a hermit in his heaven,
On summer morns, he’ll rise at seven;
Then take his way, despite the chill,
To cry aloud: ‘She’s mine, she’s mine!’
Wept violently in her sorrow,
With God knows who for neighbour,
The cobbles of Milyona Street.
All in our sage’s cell appears
The wild host vanishes from sight,
And leaves them in the gloomy light
Alone together, at his shout.
Onegin quietly carries her
To a frail bed in a corner, there,
On her shoulder leans his head;
When suddenly they’re visited,
By Olga and her lover Lensky.
Light flashes; Eugene lifts his arm,
As if to raise a magic charm
All is over: to your will
Contests their entry in a breath;
Tanya lies there, cold as death.
All is silent, shuttered, still,
Yevgeny swiftly grasps a knife, 
Louder and louder grows the quarrel,
Then Lensky falls, robbed of life,
The shadows thicken, till a dreadful
Scream rings out…the cabin shakes…
And Tanya, full of terror, wakes…!
She gazes round; the room grows light;
The dawn is breaking, crimson, bright,
Through the frosted glass, and then
The door flies open, Olga’s there,
Light as a swallow, and as fair
And rosy as Aurora when
She lights the North: ‘Now, tell me true,
Whom did your dream reveal to you?’
All is so pale and colourless,
But Tanya, seeming not to hear,
Seizes a book, with rapt attention
Turns its leaves, no word or tear; 
Yet the book has no pretension
To yield poetic inspiration,
Compelling truth, or illustration,
Though Racine, or Seneca
Virgil, Byron, Walter Scott,
Even the fashion page, could not
Enthral like Martin Zadeka,
Diviner, and Chaldean sage,
Reader of dreams to the age. 
Along with Cottin’s work Malvina,
And choke him with a tragedy,
This deep and learned opus to her,
Who’s dropped by accidentally,
But regardless of such passion,
Dog-eared, with the cover bare,
Exhausted by regret, and rhyme,
The price three-fifty for the pair,
Though in exchange he took as well,
Volume Three of Marmontel
Fables: Zadeka though was better;
He was her solace and delight,
In every sorrow that she had,
Or else (all joking aside)
Sharing her pillow every night.
They wed her, without her consent. 
All is still, only the guards
Her dream is deeply worrying her, 
Not knowing what it signifies,
She makes him her interpreter,
Seeking its meaning from the wise.
All is well: our moments fly,
Laid out in alphabetic order:
Bear, bridge, darkness, fir and forest
Snout, snow, storm, warlock, and the rest.
But her mounting trepidation
Martin Zedeka can’t allay,
Her nightmare seeming to portray,
Endless future tribulation.
For several days thereafter she
Is troubled by its mystery.
Always the Frenchman, had to bring
But now, from out the vales of morning
Aurora, rosy-fingered, brings
The new-born sun, the day is dawning,
Tanya’s birthday, filled with greetings,
As neighbouring families arrive,
And clog the Larin’s steps and drive,
With coaches, carriages and britzkas,
Calashes, broughams, and kibitkas.
The hall is crowded, shoving, pushing,
The parlour’s full of unknown faces,
Lap dogs yapping, airs and graces,
Young girls kissing, noise and crushing.
Guests bow politely at the door,
While nurses screech, and infants roar.
And here’s Gvozdin, squire and farmer,
Here, with his wife, a portly charmer,
Pustyakov the plump arrives,
And the ex-councillor Flyanov,
Whose serfs live miserable lives;
The Skotinins, turning grey,
With children of all ages, say
From two to thirty, in a row;
Petushkov next, the local beau;
Then my ‘cousin’, Buyanov,
In peaked cap, hair full of fluff,
Boldly replacing its belle Nina,
Challenge that, but here’s the thing,
Inveterate gossip, old-time gangster:
Glutton, bribe-taker, and prankster.
For Tanya, a song that children sing,
In a red peruke and glasses,
The Tambov wit, Monsieur Triquet,
He found it in some dusty album
With his offspring on display)
I’d not set the ages quarrelling. 
In love with fame, by freedom bitten,
With a familiar melody:
Réveillez-vous, belle endormie.
Long ago, Princess Alina,
Printed among the ancient airs,
Triquet, ingenious poet, dares,
To rescue it, as is his custom,
Substituting – belle Tatiana!
Times from her dear Moscow cousin,
All life, before us, seemed so fair. 
Lo, the company commander,
From the local camp, what rapture!
The girls’ true idol, at least the older
Ones whose Mamas plot his capture.
He enters…ah, what news, hurray,
The band will come: they’re on their way,
The colonel’s sent them, so, a dance!
The young girls dream, in a trance,
Anticipating future bliss.
But dinner’s served, the couples pair,
Go, arm in arm to table, where
Tanya’s the centre of all this.
They cross themselves, grace is repeated,
Then a buzz, while all are seated.
All memory of him swiftly fled
There’s a lull in conversation,
While they chew. All around,
Plates, dishes chime, in unison,
With the glasses’ clinking sound.
The room is loud and growing louder,
All the noise of talk and laughter;
No one listens, they just speak,
Hoot or argue, shout or shriek.
The door swings open, wide it flies,
Lensky’s here, and with Onegin,
Guests squeeze up to let them in,
All objects spoke mysteriously,
Places set, each finds a chair,
And, smiling, room’s made for the pair.
All pierced her to the core; and then
They sit across from our Tatyana,
She’s paler than the moon at dawn,
Lowered eyes grown clouded, darker,
Trembling like a hunted fawn.
With passion’s fire she is blazing,
Overwhelmed, near suffocating,
The two friends’ greeting scarcely hears,
While her eyes are drowned in tears.
Ready to faint, alas, poor thing,
She shivers as if she were ill,
But now her reason and her will,
Revive. Two words, a whispering,
Forced between her lips, will serve
To greet them, and to hold her nerve.
All spiteful gossip, yet his tools
Hysteria, fainting, tragic tears,
Had long bored Eugene to distraction,
He hated girls’ neurotic fears;
Experienced but the one reaction.
An awkward guest at such a feast,
Not one to savour it in the least,
He saw the poor girl’s quivering state,
He dropped his gaze, began to hate
His friend for his own presence there, 
And swore in deepening irritation,
To rouse his friend to indignation,
Repay him: and with joyful stare,
All still the same as we recall;
Of every guest there, in his mind. 
All that Onegin knew about her…
Our Yevgeny was not alone
In noting Tanya’s distress,
But all eyes were turned, I own,
On a rich pie (its saltiness,
All that is glad, lives, never mine –
Smoky bottles, tarred with twine,
To separate blancmange from roast,
And glasses, tall, with narrow waist,
Ever Love’s most alluring vial,
Like yours my darling, made to hold,
Zizi, the crystal of my soul, 
Object of my verses chaste:
Freed now of its dampened cork,
You’ve intoxicated me in style!
He frowns – and everyone is still;
It’s plain that he’s the master here,
All that was settled long ago.
Fizzing, and amidst the talk,
As verse inside him burns and glows,
Triquet rises, with noble gaze;
The noise subsides, and faces glaze;
Tatyana feels half-dead; Triquet,
Turns, page in hand then sings away
Always partly out of tune,
To cheers, applause. Tanya now
Is forced to curtsey to his bow.
Though great, our poet is immune
To pride; he’s first to drink her health,
Present his song-sheet, wish her wealth.
All that we now find absurd.
Wishes, good health, felicity,
Tanya replied to each with grace;
Eugene stood there uneasily,
Noting the pallor in her face.
Her distress, her hidden passion,
Stirred a flicker of compassion.
Then he bowed to her, in silence,
Yet revealing in his glance,
All the sad morning of his life,
His expression quite sincerely,
Or played a part unwittingly;
Half-jesting, or with true intent;
His tender look still conveyed 
All the world seems lost in sleep,
All their romance seen dimly 
The chairs scrape backwards on the floor,
They crowd into the drawing room
Like bees that leave the hive, and pour
Into the meadows, in full bloom.
But they’re replete from their labour,
Neighbour wheezes now at neighbour.
The ladies sit beside the fire;
The whispering girls elsewhere conspire;
The green card-tables are in place,
Those keenest to take part are summoned,
For Boston, claiming the old-fashioned,
Or whist, that’s never out of grace,
For all of that monotonous breed
That’s sired by boredom out of greed.
All was as grist to his mill;
Eight times our heroes at their whist 
Have played a rubber; and eight times 
Changed places: there, you have the gist,
Then tea arrives. Not by the chimes
Of clock or watch I count the hours,
In this countryside of ours,
But by breakfast, dinner, tea; 
Our stomachs ­­– prompt horology.
And I’ll mention here, in passing,
That the substance of my verse
Will often food and drink rehearse,
Popping corks, and idle feasting,
That helped you earn, divine Homer,
Your three thousand year diploma!
All, sombrely, surrounding them.
Tea, then: the girls take up, demurely,
Their steaming cups, have barely stirred,
When in the doorway, loudly, sweetly,
Flute, bassoon, are gladly heard.
Diverted by the welcome sound,
Leaving his tea and rum aground,
Petushkov, neighbourhood Adonis,
Seeks Olga’s lovely hand in his;
Lensky, Tanya’s; Kharlikova,
Maid of riper years, accepts
Triquet; Buyanov then steps
Off, in haste, with Pustyakova;
The crowd spills into the hall,
And all is brilliance at the ball.
Almanacs; and journals, too,
At the commencement of my story
I thought I’d paint (See Chapter One)
Almost embraced pure poetry –
Yet as Albani might have done;
But empty fancy’s vain distraction
Reminded me of my attraction
To little feet, entrancing ladies.
Now, no more, of ifs and maybes,
No more, dear feet, of wandering
In your traces: now youth’s done, 
No more of error and distraction,
Now I must take to sounder reasoning;
And as it ends, with this confession,
Free Chapter Five from more digression.
Alone and sad, my darling Tanya,
Now, while predictable and mindless
As giddy youth, the dancers fly,
Wheeling in its circles, tireless
Couples sweeping wildly by;
Now is the moment of revenge,
Onegin smiles as he extends
His hand to Olga, leads the girl,
Among the guests; they swiftly twirl; 
Next they sit, and talk politely,
Speak of this and that a while;
Then they’re off again in style,
For the waltz, and stepping lightly;
Alone, alone it seemed for good!
Lensky can’t believe his eyes. 
Alone, where the meadow gleams
Now, the mazurka. Long ago,
At the mazurka, floors would quake,
Heels pounding on the wood below,
Enough to make the ballroom shake,
The windows rattle in their frames.
Not now: we like more polished games,
Glide smoothly over lacquered boards,
Though a provincial town affords
Along the Neva in his sleigh,
Heels, and leaps, and long moustache,
As some old squire cuts a dash,
Along the fragile bridge’s length.
No sign of the fevered tyrant, Fashion,
That plague of every modern Russian. 
Along the streets where snow-melt lies,
Buyanov, my lively ‘cousin’ leads
Both the sisters, by the hand,
To our hero, who concedes
The dance to Olga, as he’d planned;
He dances, nonchalantly guiding
Her, while to her ear confiding,
Some subtle whispered compliment,
Presses her hand ­– his whole intent
Among the many doomed to go
Flushed and satisfied. Poor Lensky
Stares, grows mad with jealousy;
Among the snowdrifts, roars
He waits till the mazurka’s done,
And then demands the cotillion.
Among the wives and daughters seen,
She can’t. And why? Because she’s given
Her word away, she’s pledged already
To Onegin. Dear God in heaven!
What’s this he’s hearing? Can it be…?
Can this girl who’s scarcely yet
Left the cradle, play flirt, coquette,
Possess that cunning, share those vices,
Know all love’s treacherous devices!
Poor Lensky’s reeling from the blow.
He curses woman’s reckless course,
Exits, calls loudly for his horse,
Rides off. A pair of pistols though,
Two bullets ­– nothing else – await
The hour that must decide his fate.
Chapter Six
Là sotto giorni nubilosi e brevi
Nasce una gente a cui l’morir none dole.
Petrarch
There, where days are cloudy and brief,
Are born a people to whom death brings no pain.
An ace of clubs at twenty paces,
Eugene, now Vladimir had left,
Was bored again beyond all measure,
By Olga, though yet not bereft
Entirely of his vengeful pleasure;
Olga too yawns by him, sadly
Glancing round to seek her Lensky,
Tired of this cotillion;
This nightmare whirling, on and on.
At last it’s over, now it’s supper,
Then rooms are found for every guest,
An embittered mind that seethes
From the ground floor to the upper,
In attic too. Eugene, instead,
Drives home, preferring his own bed. 
An empty phantom, or a joke,
An exile, and bound to none,
Snore for snore, fat Pustyakov,
By his better half is lying.
Gvozdin, Buyanov, Petushkov,
And Flyanov, toss and turn on chairs,
In the dining room downstairs;
Triquet’s slumbering on the floor,
In shirt and night-cap, by the door;
The girls are stowed with Tatyana,
And with Olga, lost in dream;
But, lighted by Diana’s gleam,
An illustrator’s dream, and more,
Sleepless, at the window, stares 
At dark fields, mirroring her cares. 
And I – perhaps, far from the light,
Onegin’s unexpected presence;
His fleeting glance of tenderness;
His partnering Olga too, what sense
To make of that; her own distress;
And I –with a sigh, I confess –
Her failure too to comprehend;
And jealousy, you understand,
As if a cold, an icy hand
Had gripped her heart, as if a black
And seething abyss at her feet
Had opened… ‘Yet the death is sweet
He brings’ – she murmurs – ‘and I lack
Strength to complain, I confess,
Though he can’t bring me happiness.’
And I lament my former sorrow. 
But on, on with my story!
And I loved you; ah, what answer,
Five versts from Krasnogorye,
Lensky’s estate, worth a mention,
There lives, and thrives no less,
In the intellectual wilderness,
Zaretsky, once a reprobate,
Gambler-in-chief, an intimate
And sage of inns, a philanderer;
Kind and sober, now, instead,
Father of many, still unwed; 
He, as friend in need, you’ll gather,
Even as man of honour, features:
So our age improves us creatures!
And Petushkov – spurned him too.
There was a time when envious faces
Praised his sheer daring; he could hit
And Tanya all attention, keen
And pierce the very heart of it.
Carried away by his brave calling,
He made his name by simply falling: 
When far ahead of his battalion,
He toppled from his Kalmuck stallion,
Drunk as an owl, a Frenchman’s prize,
Yet a modern Regulus, the soul
Of honour: ready – it was his goal –
For capture again, should that arise,
As long as, on credit, they’d guarantee,
Three bottles a day, for him, chez Véry.
And Tanya alone, in secret, pined;
He was the practical joker, ever
Prone to lead a fool about,
By the nose; deceive the clever;
In secret, or with raucous shout;
Though he’d occasionally misfire
And end, himself, in the mire,
As much the victim of his fun,
As any passing simpleton. 
He liked debate, to point a moral,
Make a blunt or sharp retort,
At times be silent, then in sport
Cunningly begin a quarrel,
Incite two friends of his to fight,
And a host of younger girls,
And a house – where shadows pass,
Or force them to be reconciled,
And earn a luncheon with them both;
Though privately they’d be reviled,
With cruel joke, or lying oath!
Sed alia tempora! With the rest,
And all the dreams the heart holds fast.
Such things belong to youth, now dead.
For my Zaretsky, as I said,
Found refuge from the storm of life,
Beneath his cherries and acacias,
Like Horace, peaceful and sagacious,
Plants cabbages, and free from strife,
Breeds ducks and geese, while at his knee
The children learn their ABC.
And all this world dark below?
He was no fool; appreciated
By Yevgeny not for his heart
But for his wit, which he rated,
Finding him sensible, yet smart.
In the past quite frequently
He’d called, was pleasant company;
So morning brought no great surprise
When Zaretsky met his eyes.
Yet, after brief greeting, to begin
The visit, a note he proffered,
Penned by Lensky, and as he offered
The missive gave a caustic grin:
Onegin, without more ado,
At the window, read it through.
And all you ladies sentimental –
Politely, without indecision,
In as brief a cartel as was right,
Lensky, coolly, with precision,
Had merely challenged him to fight.
Onegin without hesitating,
Turned to the envoy, mutely waiting,
And spoke as if he scarcely cared,
What might result: ‘Ever prepared.’
At this Zaretsky promptly rose,
Not needing to prolong his stay,
Now anxious to be on his way,
And brought the visit to a close;
Yet left Eugene, alone, dismayed,
Unhappy with the role he’d played.
And an old man whom she’d ignored
And rightly so: For sitting sternly 
In private judgement on his action,
He condemned himself severely:
First: he’d erred in his reaction
To a love both shy and tender,
Mocked what true hearts engender;
Second: the poet might be a fool,
But then at eighteen that’s the rule;
While, holding him in such affection,
Yevgeny should have shown control,
And played a wholly different role,
Not, blown in every direction,
Go seeking quarrels, take offence,
Not as a man of honour, sense.
And anticipate his funeral.
He might have spoken openly,
Instead of bristling from the start,
Endeared himself more readily 
To Lensky’s young, receptive heart.
And as for our young votaress, 
Besides’ ­– he thought – ‘the die is cast,
Since that old duellist is vicious,
And as for trouble…well, I’m done for,
True, contempt should rightly answer
And at long last claim attention,
Will slyly whisper, grinning fools…’
And then such things are like a cancer!
For it’s our idol, honour’s mainspring,
Opinion, keeps the whole world turning!
And awkwardness, barely replies,
At home, impatient, breathing fire,
The poet awaits Eugene’s reply:
Here comes Zaretsky, colour higher,
With solemn look, and sparkling eye.
Now jealousy shows its delight!
He’d feared lest his opponent might
By slight of hand, or by some jest,
Make an escape, shield his breast
From the avenging bullet; now,
Doubt is over, they will fight,
Beside the mill, and at first light,
As soon as daybreak will allow,
Cock their pistols, and let fly,
To hit the head, or break a thigh.
And beside her, her Eugene –
Resolved to hate the false, the fickle,
Lensky, blazing with resentment,
Keen to avoid her, before the duel,
Checked the sun, his watch – and went!
And boxed you ears, a time or two!
He rode in his lover’s direction;
Olga he thought would be dismayed; 
At the unexpected move he’d made,
But no! – Down the steps, as ever,
Swiftly, she flew to meet him,
Light as air, ran to greet him,
Buoyant as hope, that soars forever;
In the same lively, carefree way
As she might on any other day. 
And church-crosses black with daws.
And dangle the careless lorgnette.
Asks him, ‘yesterday? Disturbed,
Silent, he bows his head before her,
In confusion, thoughts perturbed.
Jealousy gone, and anger’s blaze,
Faced with her open, tender gaze,
Faced with her sweet simplicity, 
Faced with her soul’s bright clarity! …
He sees, his heart filled with emotion,
At once he’s tortured by remorse,
Sees he is loved, feels the force
Of pure regret, his only notion
To be forgiven; trembles; mute;
His happiness rare, and absolute.
And dark beneath the branches’ cover,
Now full of grief he lacks the strength
To speak about the night before,
Or to examine her at length,
But broods on what he must ignore:
And hungry wolves, that loom
Not allow that coarse seducer,
With sighs or flattery, to aspire
To tempt her with his base desire.
The vile and venomous worm
Shall not attack the lily flower,
The bud of life’s fairest hour,
Shall not fade before its term.’
Which translates as: he intends
To see Onegin dead, my friends.
And in the fierce storm and strife,
If he had known what agony
Burned in my dear Tanya’s heart!
Had Tanya had the power to see
The future by some magic art,
Aware that Lensky and Eugene,
Would meet in the morning, keen
To dispute the entrance to the grave –
Love might have found a way to save
Them both, but no one knew her mind,
No one had divined her passion, 
Onegin was silent, in his fashion,
Perhaps her nurse, if she’d been blessed,
Who find November at the gate. 
With quicker wits, might have guessed.
And never asked her husband first.
As servants of the Muse have acted,
Now cheerful, now full of gloom;
At dinner, when intoxicated. 
Since time began; so, he’d resume
His seat at the clavichord,
Then play a note or two before,
Turning his troubled gaze on Olga
At home, his pistols are inspected
It’s late; and time for him to take
His leave, his heart crushed, once more,
He turns to go, and at the door,
It seems to him that it must break, 
She gazes earnestly: ‘What’s wrong?’
Blessed the day of toil and care,
Blessed the tomb’s darkness there.’
By a single thought oppressed:
Then replaced, their case shut tight;
He undresses; a book’s selected,
Schiller, to scan by candlelight.
His sad heart prevents all rest,
By chance, I have the lines, unfinished,
He seems to see his Olga, bright
In all her beauty, in the night.
Vladimir shuts the book once more,
Then poetry flows from his pen,
Full of love’s foolishness, again
Verse sounds, as he strides the floor,
Like that by Delvig’s muse created,
From the fog, the horse can scent
Golden springtime of my youth?
On the highway, snorts and quivers;
They’re here before me, his in truth:
The wary traveller first shivers,
In the album of some sweet friend,
This day to come, what will it bring?
My eyes in vain seek out the thing
That’s veiled in deepest mystery.
No matter: a just fate awaits me.
Whether I fall struck by the power
Of its arrow, or death wings by,
Sleep and waking have their hour,
Time was when she would write, in blood,
I hear the magic of your voice!
When inspired again, ecstatic,
And to delight the sensual
At last near dawn, his weary head
Then the shining day will dawn,
But he’s in error; our Yevgeny
Will know the secrets of death’s bourn;
Lethe will drown all memory
Of the poet, this world forget me,
But you, the beautiful, and dear,
Will you not stop to shed a tear
Over my urn, and think: “He loved,
By me alone his soul was moved!”…?
Come to me, come: yours, to the end!...’
Friend of my heart, eternal friend,
Now from the shed at morning light
Then dashes off uphill, in flight.
Call Praskovya, Pauline, and would
His vein then was dark and languid,
Called by his neighbour, forcefully.
Though I fail to see what’s romantic
In it: no matter, that’s by the way).
He slept at last, but fitfully,
Nodding, he laid it down instead
On the page, on the word ideal,
One with a fashionable feel.
Nor calls them to their pen at noon.
Yet sleep had barely laid its claim
On him, when he heard his name,
The hand no longer drives the cattle,
Her sing-song voice in gossip blend,
Past six, Onegin will be waiting.’
Is sleeping soundly: in the yard,
Onegin slumbers on regardless.
Sacred to scions of Apollo,
The night’s shadows thinning swiftly,
The cock-crow hails the morning star;
Perfumes in finely-crafted crystal;
The sun now dispels the darkness,
And daze the eyes of innocence,
Eugene continues to lie
In blissful sleep, it’s certain,
The winged god hovers overhead.
At last he stirs, sits up in bed
And pulls aside the curtain;
Looks out, noting it is day,
And high time to be on his way.
And not forget the pistol-case.
Hastily he rings; the servant,
Guillot, his French valet, appears;
Slippers, dressing-gown: this instant;
Fresh linen: take time by the ears;
Then Onegin swiftly dresses, 
Orders Guillot, since time presses,
To ready himself, have all in place,
Arrived, asks Guillot if he will
The sledge is waiting, at the door,
He’s in, and flying to the mill.
Carry the weapons, as before,
Down he’ll slip, and throw you too.
Spend the time indoors, reading?
The horses to the oak nearby.  
And dined with her déshabillé.
Leaning on the dam-wall, Lensky,
Resolute, impatient, waited,
While, quite the engineer, Zaretsky, 
Surveyed it, and pontificated.
Eugene came to apologise,
And eighteen nags now appear.
Zaretsky asked, ‘is your second?’
In matters of duelling reckoned
Are raised again, the work’s completed.
He’d not allow a man to die
Just anyhow and let him lie,
But by rule, and he was loath
To deviate from established ways
Before blood left its scarlet stain,
Behind the mill, while there, apart,
Behind the stump of a nearby tree
He’s here, my friend, Monsieur Guillot.
That can’t be a problem, surely
Not? Besides I’d have you know,
Though he is unknown to you,
He is a man of honour too.’
Zaretsky bites his lip, crossly,
While Onegin turns to Lensky:
Breeds fear of reconciliation.  
Vladimir replies. They start
Bullets are loaded, weapons cocked,
Zaretsky establishes what’s what
With the man of honour, and sighs;
The opponents wait, with downcast eyes.
But the world’s scornful expectation
Opponents! They’d not long been parted
By this cruel thirst to kill each other.
Not long before, tender-hearted,
Each had acted like a brother,
Sharing pleasures, meals, and thought.
Now hostility had brought
On nightmare, like those ancient feuds
Where in cold blood opposing broods,
In silence, plan each other’s slaughter.
Could they not speak and smile again,
For his love, his latest verses?
Part in kindness, giving quarter? ...
How blessed is the modern lover
Into the pans they sift the powder,
On ramrods, and they grate together,
Pistols gleam, hammers are knocked 
They say there’s no sweeter delight
She was sighing for another,
Than that for poet, day or night.
The jagged flints once firmly seated,
Who pleased her very soul, a lover,
His heart consumed with regret
Poor Guillot stands, uneasily,
While Zaretsky measures nicely,
And everything Parisian taste,
Here’s an end to all their jokes ­–
Thirty two paces, precisely. 
Each with a pistol in his hand,
Opposite his friend must stand.
And far away from our great city,
And farewell you, my true ideal,
Not yet attempting to aim,
They’ve taken four steps already,
Four fatal steps, to kill or maim.
Yevgeny, silently advances,
Raises his pistol slowly, glances;
Five more paces now they take;
Lensky, keen to avoid mistake,
Squints, half-closes his left eye,
And fed you cake!’ Tanya’s barely listening
Takes aim now – when, suddenly,
Onegin fires…the clock on high
Strikes for the poet, at the sound,
His weapon spirals to the ground. 
And finds Tatyana, no one with her;
Pressing his hand to his heart,
Lightly, he falls. His gaze betrays
Not pain, but death. So, at the start,
On a steep slope, in the sun’s rays,
And for a long while Tanya stood
Then gather momentum in its slide.
Struck by an icy chill, Onegin
Runs to his friend, gazes at him,
Calls out his name…uselessly:
He’s lost: the votary of rhyme,
Has met his fate before his time,
The storm is done, and cruelly,
The flower has faded from the bough,
The altar-fire’s extinguished now. 
And gave his neighbour’s ribs a dig.
Motionless, like one dreaming,
Strange his languor, there, at rest;
Blood from his wound is streaming,
The bullet shattering his chest.
And gazing in adoration see
Had fired this heart, pure inspiration,
Hope and love and enmity,
And godly folk will institute,
Now like some deserted place,
And guaranteed not to alarm,
Windows pale within, that fill
With shadows all its gloomy space,
The lady of the manse has fled.
Where to? God knows. The trail is dead.
And halts: what’s this, before his eyes?
It’s pleasant with a sharp remark
To infuriate your enemy,
Pleasant to see it hit the mark,
As he lowers horns, stubbornly,
To see, unwillingly, as they pass,
His own features in the glass;
More pleasant still, if he should cry,
My friends, in bending: ‘It is I!’
But the pleasantest thing of all
Is to aim at his pallid face
And here is autumn golden-browed,
And hides it suddenly from view,
Yet, should you succeed, beware,
There’s very little pleasure there.
And in Caucasian gorges, join me,
What if your pistol-shot inflicts
And in a sing-song voice confide, 
Whose rash look or sneer conflicts
With your self-image? He may offend
With some nonsense while your drinking,
Issue an angry challenge, thinking
He ought to do so – will your soul
Summon sufficient self-control
To watch him lying on the ground,
In his face the pains of death,
Hearing his last failing breath,
Stiffening, as his friends stand round,
Deaf, voiceless, never to reply,
To your heartfelt, despairing cry?
And in deep perplexity,
Still clutching his pistol, tightly,
Gripped by feelings of remorse,
Eugene stares down at Lensky,
And in his silent room recalls,
And in spring, in hidden vales,
Onegin shudders, turns, gives a cry
Summons the servant for assistance;
Then, at Zaretsky’s insistence,
They lift the cold body to its bier,
Placing it carefully in the sleigh,
Then carry the dread thing away.
The horses scent the dead, and rear,
Steel bits and traces flecked with foam,
As they fly like arrows towards home. 
And indignation’s icy passion,
Friends, for the poet now you sorrow,
Killed before his promise bloomed,
Forced to forgo that sweet tomorrow,
Prematurely blighted, doomed!
Where now are the burning passions,
Those high aims ambition fashions,
That pure emotion youth may render,
Thoughts and feelings, noble, tender?
Where is the storm of love’s extremes,
That thirst for truth, toil’s midnight flame,
The fear of error, and of shame,
And you, the bright celestial dreams,
You, phantoms born of reverie,
You, gleams of sacred poetry?
And its attendant rivulets gleam,
Perhaps for glory he was created,
Or to ease the world’s condition,
Perhaps that lyre, to silence fated,
Might have achieved its high mission,
Echoing down the years. The poet
Might have climbed Parnassus yet
Found his place, or, martyred shade,
Into the dark may have conveyed
The holy secret, lost forever, 
The power of some life-giving voice
To make the soul of man rejoice,
One that, beyond the grave, never
And jealously the world afford
Or gratitude from age to age. 
And know the answer to my query:
Or alternatively the poet
Might have met the usual fate,
Youth slipped by, years to forget,
The soul’s fire cooling of late.
The Muse he might well have deserted,
Settled, to married life converted,
Deep in the country, far from town,
Worn horns, and a dressing-gown;
And learned life’s bland reality:
At forty suffer from the gout,
Eat, drink, yawn; ill, and stout,
Then prove his own mortality,
Midst swarms of children, lie in bed,
Doctors, and weeping women, dead!
And let the proud and mocking gaze
Whatever the future might have brought,
Reader, alas, that tender lover, 
Young poet of meditative thought,
Fell at a friend’s hand! You’ll discover,
As you leave the village, a place
That inspired soul knew, a space
Where the roots are intertwined
Of two tall pines; where waters wind
Towards the valley down below;
Where the ploughman likes to take
His rest; girl reapers, keen to slake
Their thirst, clink pitchers in the flow;
Where, above shadowy waters blent,
There stands a simple monument.
And listen to the forest news,
Nearby (when the furrows ooze
With the springtime showers again)
The shepherd, weaving his bast shoes,
Sings of the Volga fishermen;
And the young city lady, down
For the summer, bored with town,
Racing the meadowlands alone
Will halt her horse beside the stone,
Grip the reins, and from her hair
Lifting the gauzy veil may glance
Lightly at the lines, by chance,
Of its inscription, feel pity there,
On reading their sad tale – surprise
And looked a poet, to the letter,
And lost in endless reverie;
Then, across the fields, slowly,
Brooding silently, she’ll ride,
Lost in the depths of reverie,
With Lensky’s fate pre-occupied;
And no confusion, no compassion?
Did she pine for him?’ She’ll wonder;
And now I must congratulate
And what of her sister, where is she?
And that fugitive from the world,
The smart coquettes’ smart enemy,
The gloomy eccentric, where is he,
Who to his grave the poet hurled?
And now the north wind drives the cloud,
To supply the details, by and by. 
And now, recalls past enemies,
But not quite yet. Although I dearly
Love my hero, as before,
And promise you, most sincerely,
I’ll return to him: no more!
And of his every caprice,
And one bright morning, off he flies,
And pass sarcastic judgement on her.
I now enjoy composing less.
Now, I no longer rush to stain
Scattered reams with flying quill,
Another dream, and one more chill,
Another care, profounder pain,
In the world’s noise, or solitude,
On my troubled mind intrude. 
And you (its rhyme forever) youth?
I’ve learnt to know another longing,
I’ve learnt the sadness of tomorrow,
In yesterday there is no trusting;
Can it be true, and not a mere
The dream! Where’s sweet elusive truth?
Can it be true, that crown at last
Conceit of elegiac verse,
Is now quite withered by the blast?
Stretched across to form a bridge,
Two slender boughs glued by ice,
And passed the time as people do,
My springtime’s over, in the sere?
Can it be true there’s no return?
And thirty years the prize I earn?
And played an honourable role,
Pale afternoon is here, my heart,
Confess it now, behold: the truth.
Then so be it: in friendship part,
Oh my frivolous lost youth!
My thanks for every sweet refrain,
The torments of the soul, the pain,
The noise, the tempests, and the feast,
For all your gifts, even the least,
My thanks. I took my joy, and more…
Lived you to the full, in riot,
Or in solitude, and quiet;
Enough! Again, my soul is pure;
I travel another road, at last,
Freed from the burdens of the past.
And prettier then, too, no doubt,
Backward, I glance. Farewell the glade,
Where days flowed by so lazily,
Filled with sweet passion, pensive shade,
Long hours of idle reverie!
And you, my youthful inspiration,
Find fresh powers; Imagination,
Rouse the dull mind from sleep,
Visit my humble corner, keep
The poet’s soul from every ill,
Let it not wither, harsh and dry,
Or worse still, freeze and petrify,
In society’s toils that kill, 
The muddy pool, my friends, that we
Immerse in, so relentlessly!
Chapter Seven
Moscow, Russia’s darling daughter,
Where shall we find your like? 
Dimitriev
How can we not love our Moscow?
Baratynsky
Scorn Moscow? Is the world so marvellous?
Where could be better? – Where there are none of us!
Griboyedov
And putting out a trembling hand 
From the neighbouring hills, the snow
Driven by the springtime sun,
Flows in turbid streams that run
Down to the flooded fields below.
Nature wakes from dream, lightly, 
Greets the new season, brightly.
And question-marks in several books.
And still transparent to the eye
The naked woods show downy green.
Out of its waxen cell, the bee 
Goes to raid nature’s treasury.
The valleys show a dappled sheen;
The cattle low; a nightingale,
In night’s deep silence, tells its tale. 
And quiet her voice: ‘Have done,
And yet how sad you seem to me,
Spring, ah Spring! The time of love!
With what strange languid agony,
You fill my soul, and my blood!
How heavy the emotion weighing
On my heart, to feel the straying
Breath of spring caress my face,
In some peaceful rural place!
Are all such things quite alien
To me – joyous things that shine,
And seems an utter alien here,
Bringing boredom, anguish, then,
To a soul that perished long ago;
And she, whose lines I sketched
And sings, and plaits a lime-bark shoe.
Or un-consoled by the return
Of leaves that vanished in the fall,
Do we recall those doomed to burn,
Hearing fresh whispers sigh and call? 
Or finding Nature re-awaken,
Our past forever dead, forsaken,
Perhaps the troubled soul remembers
Years long gone, now faded embers?
Or some poetic reverie
And slips away, as chance may please,
Of another, older spring,
And, in the aching heart, set free
Dreams of a country, lost too soon,
O magic night, enchanted moon…
And so my Tanya began
It’s time, you inveterate idlers,
Whom Epicurean maxims rule,
You fortunate philosophers,
You acolytes of Levshin’s school,
You rustic Priams, elemental,
And so we part, again farewell!
Spring calls you to the fertile soil,
Warmth, growth and outdoor toil,
And to those seductive nights,
Long walks, and fresh inspiration,
To the fields, my friends! Run, run!
In coaches, burdensome or light,
Drawn by post-horses, or your own,
Forgo the city’s ceaseless drone.
And soon our Olga’s chiming voice
And you, my dear indulgent reader,
In foreign gig that you employ,
Flee the metropolis, its bother,
That all last winter gave you joy;
Join me and my capricious Muse,
And soon reveal their better nature,
Beside that nameless river shore,
That our Yevgeny found a bore,
And where he spent those icy days,
As a recluse, idle, gloomy,
Near young Tatyana, whom we 
Know lives in a dreamy haze;
Where he’s no longer to be found,
Though sad echoes still resound.
And sound in every Russian heart!
Deep in the hill-encircled valley,
We’ll take the trail towards the stream,
Through meadows, down a lime-tree alley,
To where the silent shallows gleam,
Where the nightingale, spring’s lover,
Sings all night, wild roses cover
Bank and brake, sweet waters flow –
Where two shadowy pine trees grow,
The passer-by can read the legend
On the stone, with his own eyes
And speaks to them, as to old friends.
Who met with an untimely end,
At such and such a date, and age;
Rest, poet, from your pilgrimage.’
On a pine-branch bending there
Over the simple urn below,
Through the wood she flees the bear;
When morning breezes filled the air, 
I found an honest plain old dear,
Only the shepherd, aged now,
Their arms entwined about each other,
Two girls, when the moon shone clear,
Would haunt the grave, and shed a tear.
Today…no wreath hangs on the bough,
The woodland path is overgrown,
The tale forgotten and the stone;
Sits there as he’s accustomed to,
The soft snow reaches to her knee;
Though that cranberry juice may kill:
And spirit finds creative fire.
Poor Lenksy! Not for long did Olga
Pine for you, and mourn your fate!
And stride in arches every way,
The dove will soon forget its mate.
Another captured her attention,
Another star had its ascension,
Flattery soon soothed her pain,
And the shame dishonour brought,
And then demand an expression
Soon, beneath the bridal crown,
At the altar, head bowed down,
She stands, blushing with emotion,
Lowered eyes their gleams eclipse,
While a soft smile adorns her lips. 
And then, to part us utterly…
Poor Lensky! In the grave’s far bourn,
Beyond the voiceless boundary,
Did the singer sadly mourn
His knowledge of her frailty?
Or by Lethe blissfully
In deep forgetfulness, does he
Sleep soundly, in oblivion,
The world to him both sealed and dumb? ...
So be it! Neutral nothingness
Awaits us all, at the end,
Voice of lover, foe and friend,
Falls silent. Only heir, heiress,
Are heard, perverse, insatiate,
Quarrelling over our estate.
And there a seasoned traveller,
And there grew wild as they: all sense,
Was heard at the Larin’s no more:
Back to his regiment, her choice
Must go, a slave to army law.
The old mother, broken-hearted,
Wept for her daughter; as they parted
It seemed she could barely breathe;
Yet Tanya scarcely seemed to grieve;
Only a strange sad pallor clouded
Her face, like one about to die.
When on the porch they said goodbye,
Kissed, and fussed about, and crowded
Round the carriage, she was there,
To say her farewells to the pair. 
And there, where bold Melpomene,
And therefore my fall from grace
Eyes misted, as they sped away…
And to deep emotion yields:
And to the revels and the feast,
Her confidante, her own sweet dove,
The ally she was born to love,
Is carried far from her by fate,
Forever now, they separate.
She wanders, purposeless, a shade,
Gazes at the empty garden,
Seeing nothing there to gladden,
No solace in the silent glade:
By melancholy tears oppressed,
Her aching heart can find no rest. 
And wake her many and many a time,
Now, in her cruel isolation,
Her silent passion’s more intense,
Onegin, in this desolation,
Far off, invades her every sense.
She knows she must not see him, ever
That she should hate him now forever,
The murderer of their dear friend;
The poet is no more…the end
Of all, oblivion; this too,
His darling to another wed;
And, if permitted, by and by,
Like smoke dispersing in the blue;
Two hearts there are, two that grieve
Perhaps, for him…And yet, why grieve?
Dusk falls. The sky is dark. The river
From the field, with hushed tones.
Quietly flows. The beetle drones.
The rural dancers now retire
Hovers, still these girls will hide
On the far bank, the smoky flare,
Are treated in the kindest way
In the silvery moonlight, dreams,
Tatyana takes herself to bed,
Walks on forever: on and on.
Then from the heights she sees
The love-god, Lel, overhead
Arrive, and greeted heartily,
She gazes – feels a throbbing start,
While faster, stronger pounds her heart.
As if before some mournful parting,
She hesitates, is filled with doubt:
At first they make but little sense, 
I’m not known; he’s not about…
Why not view the house, or garden?
So scarcely breathing, she descends
The hill slope and where it ends
Looks about her…fate has brought
Her to the wide deserted court:
The dogs run towards her, barking,
But swiftly, at her nervous cry,
From the yard the serf-boys fly,
At home they’re already waiting,
Drive the dogs off, to ensure
That Tanya can reach the door.
At the gate, says her goodbyes, 
Before the young man’s death, he’d dine,
Tatyana asks: And instantly
The lads run to find a guide:
Blows chill; the sleeping groves, around
The old crone comes at their call,
Ushers Tanya through the hall,
Echoing in its emptiness:
Our hero’s previous address.
She gazes: a discarded cue
Lies on the billiard table’s top,
On the divan, a riding-crop.
The housekeeper nods her through:
But it grows late; the wind as well
The master often brooded there.’
But she takes fright, my Tatyana,
But wonders come to her in dreams:
By that window: now I pray
In winter-time. Please, follow me:
Here’s his study, he’d recline
On that very couch, and rest;
Sip coffee; or at his request
The steward came; he’d read a book…
See here too, my old master’s nook;
He’d sit here of a Sunday,
Don his spectacles to see
The cards, and play whist with me,
Byron was there – and novels, one
His soul’s at peace, his bones at rest:
That they by Mother Earth are blessed! 
Cast-iron statue which they pass,
Tatyana with deep emotion,
Gazes, painfully, around her;
Each object is, to her notion,
Into the shadows, still the same,
The soul with torment and delight;
The desk with its shaded light,
The pile of books, then the bed
With a Persian fabric spread,
The twilit view beyond the glass, 
The clouded moon, and on the wall
Lord Byron’s portrait, by a small
Custom demands. They sat and sat,
Napoleon, arms crossed, with that 
Wide gloomy brow and bicorn hat.
Departs the room, yet asks Anisya
In this fashionable monk’s cell,
Tatyana lingers: she’s spell-bound.
To make a passer-by think twice:
Politely mentioning various topics, 
The darkened river, vapours fill;
The moon is hidden by a hill;
Despite the lack of streets and yards,
It’s time to leave. Feigning calmness,
Our Tanya, not without a sigh,
Enters the study silently,
If she might return to see her,
That room to sit in, read, and muse. 
Though the house is empty, use 
There she stands, helplessly.
Filling the silences with gossip:
She parts then, from the housekeeper,
Had vanished long ago, and yet
Yet at dawn the restless sleeper
Wakes, and to the house she flies.
Lost in her own deep reverie,
Hidden from the world: while pale,
Oblivious of the world around her,
She weeps. The books surround her,
Onegin’s love for books, we know,
Though, in her indifference,
She samples them, and as if called
Then, intrigued by the collection,
She wanders through a snowy vale
To an unknown world’s enthralled. 
The polished table shines, I fear 
Wrapped in mist and gloom, it seems
Those dishes of preserves appear,
He saw as clear as the dawn,
There were some favourites he kept;
Poet of the Giaour and Don Juan,
His spirit egotistical,
Or two, the age drawn with élan,
Jugs of cranberry juice, all that
Penned with unerring accuracy,
Time dragged slowly or it flew,
Of dances, poetry, and cards,
On many pages could be seen
The Academic Dictionary. 
With vain ideas the brain conceives.
The country caused the same ennui
The imprint of his fingernail,
Though I’ve consulted frequently
But you, the men in wedded bliss,
To follow him, pursued the trail,
Trembling too, with her intent,
To see what fresh enlightenment,
Eugene had found, with what word
He’d agreed, what found absurd.
In the margins where, with care,
He’d made pencil marks, his soul
Was revealed, recorded whole,
Unconsciously, apparent there:
Now an underline; now a dark
Comment; now a question-mark.
By fate’s implacable decree.
They’d welcome you with great delight.’
By the third, field, wood, and hill,
His nature, comprehend the man, 
For whom her heart was made to burn,
Had she found the word at last?
That sad and dangerous mystery,
Was he from Heaven or from Hell,
Had she solved the conundrum,
Which was he? Mere imitation,
Tanya sleeps, at peace below. 
With old-fashioned hospitality.
He even felt the urge to yawn,
Her mother’s scarcely reconciled:
Taking her nurse’s fond advice,
Introduce me.’ ‘Now, you’re jesting.’
No longer even stirred his will, 
It’s peppered with them to excess,
The clock runs swiftly on and on,
The guests have come, the hour is past,
She’s the subject they’re debating:
The babbling brook, the silent furrow,
Too often by a foreign word,
What traps he set for those abused!
And we can all display éclat,
Tanya should be married too.
But what on earth is one to do?
She turns them all down, instead
It’s: “I won’t.” Then on her own
She’ll brood, or roam the woods alone.’
And whatever stirs her soul,
And when I fled that company,
Buyanov’s asked her: she refused.
And why? What am I striving for?
That Hussar, Pykhtin, she confused,
He was quite infatuated,
Flattered her, smiled, ingratiated
Himself! I thought: “He’s the one,”
But no! Not a bit of it, he’s gone.’ –
And will be faithful to my vow.’
Moscow’s a better market-place!
The setting for a pretty face.’ –
And with a smile, and an abrupt
And with what storms his body shook!
Come, borrow from me, within reason.’ 
Funds for a Moscow winter found.
Her mother always valued greatly
Of fashions always out of date,
The accounts were done, and swiftly
Of shy provincial innocence,
Tanya had news of the decision.
To face society’s derision,
Present the clearest evidence
Of simple speech and rural ways
Slides to rest, her fall complete;
Slithers, and slips, in a trice,
And wore, her last defences down,
Of beaus and Circes speak her fate! ...
Oh, horror! Better safely hidden
Deep in the woods, than do as bidden.
And yet it’s one I can’t translate;
Rising with the morning light,
She rushes to the open fields,
Her sad eyes tearful and bright,
And yet my Onegin’s etched.
And yet with a pretended coldness
You too, familiar hills, I fear;
And you, familiar woods I love,
Farwell beauty of skies above;
Farewell nature, my joy, adieu;
I leave such quiet haunts as these
For a noisy world of vanities…
Farwell to you, my freedom, too!
And yet, I am another’s now,
What future does fate hold in store?’
And you my constant care, yes you
And your reproach repay in kind.
There is a stream, and here a hill,
That with sheer beauty charms Tatyana
Arresting her against her will.
Seeking their charms she goes to meet
The groves and meadows at her feet,
And, heedless of the cold, she turns
Yet all too soon the summer ends,
And, in vain tedium, I play out
Then nature trembles, deathly pale,
And, mist on meadows everywhere,
And, seated quietly by my side,
Blows and howls – and presently,
The Enchantress, Winter: here is she!
Another door, he flings it wide,
Scattering herself abroad, she flies,
Whitening the oak boughs, and fills
With her carpet, billowing where it lies,
The meadows and the slopes of hills;
Levels the borders of the stream,
Covered with sheets of downy gleam;
The frost glitters. We give thanks,
Welcome with joy the winter’s pranks.
But Tanya’s spirit is unmoved,
Indifferent to wintry delights;
Breathing the frosted air of nights;
Washing, with fresh snow, removed
From the roof, face, shoulders, breast.
By winter her mute heart’s oppressed.
Appears consumptive in his anguish.
The long-delayed departure day
Is here at last, the journey planned,
The sledded coaches, stored away,
Re-upholstered, there they stand,
Three large kibitkas, by tradition.
Their loads are placed in position;
Chairs, chests, and watering-cans,
Jars of jam, and frying-pans,
Featherbeds, cockerels in cages,
Pots and basins, jugs; the kind
Of things none dare leave behind;
Then the servant’s noise presages
Loud farewells, with many a tear;
Apuleius won my praise,
Arrive to laughter, schoolboy jests,
They’re harnessed to the master’s sleighs,
While the breakfast is preparing,
The load on each kibitka sways,
Wenches and coachmen swearing;
The bearded outrider’s astride
His nag: it’s ill, it nearly died.
The servants gather by the gate,
To call a last farewell: it’s late;
The ladies seated; then away:
Cast-iron spans will leap the river,
Farewell, lonely sanctuaries.’
In procession, sleigh by sleigh.
Fine inns too, all along the route.
Tatyana, with tear-stained eyes.
Have had sufficient time to act
When progress and enlightenment
I’ll seize a neighbour by the collar,
Now estimates we need, in fact,
Or after a long tedious dinner,
Like him her dress was elegant.
Will be improved to take such loads:
Russia will be one great highway,
Unifying every by-way.
The indulgence of a childhood friend;
To drive bold tunnels underwater,
We’ll move the mountains, and pay
To whom in rural solitude,
To products of my inspiration,
Like him she wore the latest fashion,
As Muraviev, our Yevgeny.
But as it is, our roads are bad;
Our neglected bridges crumble,
The fleas at halts drive you mad,
Force you to lie awake, and mumble. 
Inns, there are none. In some hut,
Freezing cold, a menu’s put
Before you, simply to excite,
In vain, your growing appetite;
Meanwhile the village Cyclops toils,
Slowly, by his slumbering fire, 
With Russian hammer, he’ll aspire
To mend Europe’s dainty coils, 
Blessing Russia’s ruts and ditches
Made by sorcerers and witches. 
As affected, strange and vicious,
Yet in frozen winter time
Travel’s easy, a delight;
Like modern verse, our empty rhyme,
The roads are smooth, the burden light.
So lively are our charioteers,
Our troikas fit to run for years,
The mile-markers soothe the eye,
Like fence-posts swiftly flashing by.
But then Larina crawled along;
To avoid the usual expense
Of post-horses, it made sense
To use their nags, and so prolong
The tedious halts that, with delays,
The journey took them seven days.  
As conversation slowly dies,
Yet now they’re near. Before them lies
White Moscow, stone and blazing fire
Where cupolas raise to glowing skies
Their golden crosses, lifted higher. 
As dazzling as a flashing sabre,
I suddenly beheld that view,
Of park and palace, spire and dome,
With all its mysteries of home.
How often, dumb with separation,
In my nomadic exile, then,
Moscow, I dreamed of you again!
Moscow….what depths of fascination
Live in that name, what echoes start,
But there was no capitulation,
Crawling to him on her knees,
Surrounded by its ancient trees
There the Petrovsky palace rises,
Proud, in its glorious memories,
For here, elated by the prizes
Fate had granted, Napoleon, 
Waited on Moscow’s submission,
From here, plunged in thought, he saw
To offer up the Kremlin keys.
He drinks – the creatures howl and swill,
My Moscow chose not to bow; 
No gift, no feast she gave him now,
Only a mighty conflagration.
He laughs – and they all fall about,
The threatening flames skyward soar.
As for Lensky’s fate, you know,
Proud witness of that fallen glory,
Farewell! No lingering here,
Drive on! And, to resume our story,
The city gates gleam white; they’re near;
Then down Tverskaya Street they bump,
Stalls flash by, and urchins jump, 
Lamp-posts, mansions, monasteries,
Kitchen-gardens, balconies,
Sleighs and shacks and boulevards,
Cossacks, Bokharans, merchants,
Pharmacies, towers, and peasants,  
Fashionable shops, and yards,
Lions on gates, with frozen roars,
Calls her welcome from the sofa;
Consumptive, four years past, and failing.
This whole exhausting journey takes
Two hours at least, but then, once past,
St Chariton’s, the carriage brakes;
Move in their harmonious sphere…
They’ve come to an old aunt who’s ailing 
Tatyana the pale garden gains,
Dear Lord, enough, enough! Have pity!
Flings wide the door, he holds a sock
He darns, old spectacles adorn
His face, the princess, in the parlour,
Her plight indeed is most forlorn;
The two old women weep, embrace,
Then rattle on at lightening pace. 
You’re really going? And so swiftly?
For two days it was all quite new,
As it is, I ask forgiveness, 
As meek, as deaf, who, nothing new,
Darling, how long can you stay here?’
As the shadows slowly wane,
From a novel, yet here you are…!’ –
Asked her name, straightened his wig,
Behind the strange bed’s silken drapes,
Cousin, it’s like a dream to me…
Do you recall your Grandison?’
Betray me, while you poor thing
Where is he, now?’ ‘You’ll never guess,
In Moscow, he’s near St Simeon,
He visited at Christmas…Oh!
His son was wed not long ago,’
But Tatyana, scarcely hears
But drawing-room pre-occupation
For all of that now, have we not?
We’ll show off Tanya, a pity though
I can’t go out: my legs they’re what
But never a fresh thought all day,
Must be worn out with travelling;
Oh, I’ve no strength…it’s my chest…
We both should take a little rest…
It’s all too much such happiness,
But none of them have changed a bit,
No use it seems, any more:
Old age is pain and wretchedness…’
With that her weary voice gave out;
She wept, endured a coughing bout. 
But only a yard, strange, immense,
The invalid’s kind words must fill
Tanya with gratitude, and yet
She finds all unfamiliar, still,
Her former room she can’t forget.
Calling Moscow to its labours;
She lies for hours, while sleep escapes
Her eyes: the bell towers chime,
Nothing from that darkened glass,
Seated by the window pane
Seeing its sad face tremble, pass…
But, listen, Lensky, when shall I see
No fields prove to be her neighbours,
Comparing notes, like circling sharks,
Stables, kitchens, and a fence.
Concealing its reality. 
They dine out at the relatives
Every day, both near and far;
Despite the pallor languor gives,
Grandmamma and grandpapa
Welcome her with open arms,
With exclamations at her charms,
Greet her enthusiastically,
With copious hospitality.
Dreaming, understanding nothing,
Last year was it? I dandled you!
Embellished by their jealousies.
Even their slanders meaningless,
To the old dears’ perennial cry:
Fashionable Record Office clerks,
Finds her Ideal, and fitfully
Fluff her hair to suit, dear creature,
They keep to their habitual ways:
There’s Princess Helena’s tulle bonnet,
The one she wore in former days;
Powder-white Lukerya Lvovna;
Glad now that his former ways
Ivan Petrovich, none the wiser;
Semyon Petrovitch, still the miser;
With Aunt Pelageya Nikolevna
Her same friend Monsieur Finemouche,
The same husband, the same pooch,
Her spouse the club’s most loyal member,
Still eats and drinks enough for two. 
Were changing with the passing days.
For trousers, dress-coat, or for vest;
Their daughters offer their embraces,
Then gaze at Tanya, silently,
They, dear Moscow’s living graces,
Survey provincial mystery;
They find her strange, somewhat affected,
Unfashionable, but that’s expected,
Guarding with unconscious art
In all, not unacceptable,
Invite her home, too, in the end,
Now Tanya stares in fascination
Squeeze her hand, kiss their friend,
Hospitable, a family grind,
He who had never once concealed
Some girlish secret that they hide.
Her voice tender, sweet and low,
Tell of their conquests, others’ too,
Their hopes, their pranks, their reveries;
The guileless stories, not a few
His rustic answer: ‘Agafon’.
In exchange, her hopes and fears;
Of her own heartfelt confession,
Shapes where her own imagination,
Watching the molten wax assume,
Tea, and jam, and endless prattle,
His wastefulness and lack of plan.
The deepest secret of her heart,
The joy and pain she’s cherishing,
Hoarding her treasure silently,
Lights the mind with its bright ray,
Like a reed-pipe, pure, her sigh:
The chatter, and the conversation,
She feels are things she should share,
Not even a joke half-innocent, 
With vulgar tales is coarse and bare.
Not even just by accident,
Not even plain idiocy redeems,
Their questions pointless, dry and dull;
Stale gossip, news, of that they’re full,
Quite rarefied, review my Tanya,
She rushes to him, on tiptoe,
This idol for your mind, and pen,
Your tears, verse, et cetera, when? ...
The coolness of the dark glades too,
Their empty world, or so it seems.
The crunch of snow…someone goes by;
This Phyllis, who’s so interesting,
The solitariness of the meadow,
My style is rendered quite absurd
How poisonous the words he used!
One melancholy jester leaning
In the doorway, idly preening,
No Russian terms exist, confess,
Rhymes her, in an elegy.
Once calling on an aunt, the bored
Prince Vyazemsky sat beside her,
Was for a while her entertainer;
To his rivals, that whole set,
God be thanked, some imitation,
As his horses plough the dust,
As if a lightning bolt had struck.
As some deceit the eye lays bare,
Wailing aloud her tragic part,
Waves her mantle, somewhat tawdry,
Grants an indifferent crowd her art;
Where Thalia is quietly napping,
Heedless of their friendly clapping;
Where only fair Terpsichore,
Awakes a young man’s loyalty,
As tedious phantoms? Is that spleen,
Our days of youth, now past and done)
No lorgnettes were trained upon
Our Tanya, no discerning eye,
No connoisseur with opera glass,
From loge or parterre, saw her pass.
As the fields by springtime rain:
She graces the Assembly Rooms:
The crush, the stir there, and the heat.
The blare of music, and the fumes
Of candlelight, the dancers fleet,
Proud beauties’ in their flimsy dresses,
The balcony, whose throng oppresses,
Marriageable girls there, in a crescent,
Muddling the wits of all those present.
Here acknowledged dandies strut
Display their vests, or form a set,
Bark, laugh, whistle, sing and screech,
While Hussars, on leave, have but
To show themselves, twirl, and jingle,
Shine, conquer, and retreat, still single.
Beyond my importunate lyre,
The glittering night holds many a star,
The Moscow belles are many too,
Yet brighter shines the moon by far
Than they, in that celestial blue.
Yet the one whom I set higher,
Blessed our first poor offerings;
Like the majestic moon serene
But enough, enough: you’ve paid
With what heavenly grace, advances,
Touching the earth with her light feet,
What languor fills her breast, my sweet!
What languor’s in her magic glances!…
By a pillar, between two aunts, 
The tribute that to folly’s made.
Byron
Noise, laughter, curtsey, bow, 
Mazurka, gallop, waltz…they dance.
Unnoticed, Tanya seated now,
Chapter Eight
Gazes unseeing at the swirl,
Detesting all the social whirl,
It stifles her…her spirit yearns
For rural life, and memory turns
To her village, despite its hovels,
The lonely grove where a stream
Clasps in her hand a book, in French.
Her garden, her romantic novels,
Or the lime-tree alley’s shade,
Where he his visitation made.
Glancing stealthily at the door. 
So far away her visions wander;
The world; the ball, are left behind,
Yet one keen gaze has settled on her,
Nudge each other, slyly wink,
The aunts, unsure what to think,
Onegin drinks amidst the roar,
Then poke Tatyana, whispering:
Delayed though, temporarily,
Derzhavin he who tuned his art
Derzhavin, at the grave’s dark sill,
Two, in uniform; he hardly took
His eyes from you…there now, quickly,
He’s walking off…he’s sideways on…’
Derzhavin, lingering here a while
Enough. My shoulder’s from the plough!
Fare thee well!  and if for ever,
Tanya on her luck, but swiftly
Turn to my hero, lest his fate
Should be forgot…so, opportunely,
I’ll set a few words echoing:
It is of my young friend, I sing,
He nods – and there’s a mighty shout;
May this, my epic, if you please,
O Muse, receive your blessing now;
With your staff point out the way,
Lest from the chosen path I stray.
Fashionable rings they need.
I’ve bowed to classicism: you,
Though late, have the exordium too!
Felitsa’s virtues set to rhyme –
For wilful passion was my measure,
Still forever, fare thee well.
Horses’ hooves and human speech!
In that sweet golden youth of mine:
In those old Lyceum days,
In the first bright flower of youth,
It, lest some sly, caustic reader,
While Cicero I loathed, in truth;
Like a Bacchante, danced along 
Where the swan in beauty sails,
Over waters still and clear,
There the Muse first came near.
Then my student cell was bright
The Muse set my world alight,
Sang youthful joy, and childhood dear,
Sang Russia’s glorious ages past,  
My flighty mistress and my pride,
My lively Muse and I enjoyed
The world received her with a smile,
Those first successes gave us wings;
On the far heights, where he strayed,
Our poor Tatyana recognises,
The noble ode’s great master still;
Then in the crowd inside that hovel,
Some claimed the marriage was agreed,
To speak the language of the heart;
Who mingled with some pure lament,
Tatyana was betrothed: some knew!
Thoughts of fleas and lemonade;
Yet built an eternal monument,
O country life! I like you all,
Though we decried them, at the time.
Tasting the crowd’s idle pleasure,
The one she fears and idolises –
The only law that I employed;
Who but the hero of our novel? 
Stated it quite positively,
The noisy brawl, the banquet’s roar,
Taunting the watch at midnight’s door;
Pleased as I always am to stress,
She brought her glories, never ceased
To sing for the guests above the wine;
That Onegin is not me, recall 
Wooed by all that ardent throng,
The Muse was ever at my side.
The sumptuous mansion gleams,
While behind the window streams
Content forever with their life,
Far off…the Muse followed after.
For the Father of the Universe.
How often, with some secret story
She’d divert me, or her laughter,
On my long and silent journey;
Galloping onwards at my side!
Like pale Lenore, in moonlit ride,
How often to the Tauric shore,
In red night-cap, a second rider
She’d lead me in the dead of night,
To hear the Nereids’ whispers bright,
The thundering breakers’ mighty roar,
The praise the endless tides rehearse,
Mounts a goose’s neck, a skull! 
Hosts of rumours in circulation,
Its feasts forgotten and its speeches,
Its sails a creaking whirligig;
She’d visit every spot with me,
Of Moldavia’s gloomy reaches;
Nomadic tribes in humble tents;
Jokes and carping comments too, 
The language of the gods, her songs
Flowers, love, fields, and idleness,
Strange broken music of the steppes…
Then all was altered, and again,
Through my garden, once urbane
Now a provincial girl, she steps;
Sad-eyed there, sits on a bench,
My Muse with a grand soirée;
Now, for the first time, I reward
Oil-lamps bright on window sills,
Or cuckold, foolish, of that clan
As well-read, but opinionated,
Sight of her sweet rural display.
Past the ranked aristocrats,
Military dandies, diplomats,
Then proud ladies, see her glide,
As, my Onegin, I do you.
Asleep it seems on melting snow,
The gleam of wit and silken dress,
The presentation of the guests
To the young hostess, one by one;
The ladies framed by gentlemen,
At every single thing he hated,
At fifty tolerably debt-free,
She likes the orderly progression,
The conversation of the powerful,
Pride’s cold politeness, the procession
Of rank and age with which the hour’s full.
But who, in this select assembly,
Is he, who lingers silently,
At home receives him equably,
To whom the passing forms appear
At ill-bred men he deprecated,
Or tortured vanity, dark, quiescent, 
In his face? Why is he present?
Who is the man? Is this Eugene?
Truly? ...Yes, indeed, our hero!
At lies with which the press was rife,
At one of whom his recollection
At some soirée where…not a word,
Is he as strange now as before?
Is it the same plan he once followed,
He pursues, or something more,
Or less: what role? Perhaps Melmoth,
Cosmopolitan, patriot,
Childe Harold, bigot, or Quaker,
Some new work of the mask-maker,
Or a decent fellow – you or me,
Society, in short? What I’d advise
Is: change your ways, if you’re wise.
He’s fooled us far too long, and so…’
At some vile novel’s reputation,
At tea too sweet, banal Madame,
At the campaign, the snow, his wife.
Why are you so unforgiving?
Is it because we’re given, clearly,
To judging other ways of living;
Or that a fiery headstrong soul
Is found disturbing, on the whole, 
By self-satisfied nonentity;
Or intellect prompts mockery; 
Or we confuse deeds with chatter,
Rewarding the merely meretricious;
Or that the stupid are malicious;
Or we mistake the things that matter;
That only mediocrity
Suits the likes of you and me?’
At the table takes her place,
Blessed is he, who in youth was young,
Who only ripened in good time;
Who, as the years went by unsung,
Learnt to endure their colder clime;
Who never harboured foolish fancies,
Never scorned the world’s advances,
In his twenties, a dandy bred,
His thirties, profitably wed,
At the turning of the years,
Obtaining wealth, and rank, and fame,
Discarding friends to win the same;
At those sisters’ royal decoration,
Of whom the age is bound to say:
X was a fine man, anyway.
Autumn’s gales reveal time’s treason,
Blown by the wind, in swift decay.
Was granted to us all in vain,
Hourly we betrayed its truth,
Hourly it cheated us, again:
Our brightest hopes, and the best,
Our dreams, those dearer than the rest,
Like autumn leaves, that fall and stray,
Driven by its laws and fashions,
Unbearable to see before us
The formal dinners stretch ahead,
Find life a ritual, dull and dead,
Follow the bland crowd that bores us,
Indifferent to its thoughts and passions.
Yet, inclined to treat them lightly,
Be careful of your horses step,
It’s wretched (I trust you’ll agree),
Once scorned by the malicious,
To be condemned impartially,
Be so enslaved, so cruel, so blind?’ 
Beat the servant girls and cursed,
Became a bore, it seemed, unending.
Or else that Demon of my verse.
Onegin (once more I rehearse
His story) having killed his friend,
Without an aim on which to fix,
Reaching the age of twenty-six,
Bored with leisure in the end,
Found, without rank, career, or wife,
Nothing to occupy his life. 
Because, rich, noble, the conventions
He was pursued by a vexatious
Restlessness, an urge for change
Before he’s drained life to the lees,
Though some of us are born to range.)
He left his village and his land, 
The fields, the woods, that silent stand,
Where the mute and blood-stained shade
Of Lensky haunted every glade;
Began an aimless wandering,
Stirred by a solitary emotion;
Till travel, with its tedious motion,
Beside fair Nina Voronskaya,
From Griboedov took Chatzky’s cue,
Sped back towards the ball, anew. 
Betrays no trace of coquetry,
Where now, exchanging looks, the guests
Stir, as the murmuring swells; for lo,
But back now to our theme: Madame,
With a large general in tow. 
Calm, her gestures unobtrusive,
Not cold at all, yet not effusive,
No pride, and no chilly glance,
No pretension in her advance,
No breath at all of haughtiness,
No affected coquetry….
Only serene simplicity.
She seems the image, to excess,
Of comme il faut… (Shiskov, forgive:
I can’t translate that, as I live!) 
Cannot quite eclipse her neighbour.
The women all gathered to her;
Dowagers smiled as she passed by;
The men all bowed deeply to her,
Each one tried to catch her eye;
Young girls, hurrying, fell quiet;
The general, flattered by the diet
Of pure respect, followed behind,
Chest puffed out, content in mind.
She was no beauty, that is true,
Yet she’d not a single trace
In all her person, form or face,
Of what the fashionable view,
In London sets especially,
Considers vulgar. (Pardon me…
Despite her beauty bright as fire,
I love the word, it’s so expressive,
Far into the silent hollows;
Its use to date is not excessive,
The honour paid it is not great;
Though it’s perfect for an epigram…).
Heaped with snow; glittering there
Nonchalantly, full of grace,
Here’s a wood: in beauty, pines
Meet the sky in sombre lines,
The Cleopatra of the Neva,
Yet you’ll agree I hope, that diva,
Their branches, as she stumbles on,
Press on! Andryushka, quicker, quicker!
Too dark for driving some would claim, 
For rural silence, where the lyre
She plunges on, he grunts and follows,
More than usual?’ ‘No, the same. 
I was born for quiet existence
Better to hurry to the ball,
Between the lines that met his sight,
Birch, and lime, and aspen bare,
Is merely vague, and lost in gloom.
He’d make conversation with her,
The Spanish ambassador, there,
Is speaking? See, she’s wearing red.’ 
The Prince, amused, turns his head,
I’ll introduce you. Upon my life!’ –
To gaze on, of the former Tanya;
Blessed is he…although she might
Blessed is he, who leaves the feast,
Brighter than finest parquet gleams
How long?’ – ‘Oh, two years or so.’ –
I was their neighbour.’ ‘Come, my friend…’
Or, as if they’d ceased to exist,
The Prince presents him, in the end:
The ice that paves the hidden streams,
Books of sentimental verse,
With no apparent consternation,
The Princess gazes at Eugene,
Bring fresh beauty to the view –
However much it takes its toll,
Not a tremor can be seen:
Her manner is as self-contained,
Her nod as quiet and restrained. 
Bringing flowers, and ripening fruit.
Browsed through Gibbon and Rousseau,
Extends, and tries the gleaming ice,
Float in a gondola’s embrace,
Names like Akulka, not Céline.
I’ll breathe free, take my ease
Brushes of thirty different sizes,
But…my mother’s tears, her prayer
But – could not. She asked a question:
But gaze at him, as she surveys…
Where had he come from, and when,
From his estate, perhaps: and then
Conveyed a hint, a mere suggestion,
Of boredom to her spouse, was gone…
While Eugene, frozen, lingered on. 
But he is stubborn and persists,
Can this really be Tatyana,
But if you knew this agony:
In this same romance, earlier,
He’d addressed a multitude
Of noble phrases, moral too,
Though over-zealous, it is true;
The very girl, he’d kept her note,
Who freely, ardently, once wrote
Out all the content of her heart;
That young girl…is it a dream...?
That young girl, it would seem
He’d scorned, for her lack of art,
Was she the one who but now
Revealed that calm, indifferent brow?
Days and nights an anguished joy.
He leaves the ball, and pensively
Drives home again, where that night
Without doubt, Eugene adores
Frost already, frozen noses,
Subject now to passion’s laws;
Meadows silver, sunlight meagre…
But in the end came to prefer
But in the late and barren season,
But merely pleasant conversation,
But now a clink of spurs, and here
But of those, good friends, insistent,
What stirs there, hidden from the eye?
Vexation? Vanity? Or, in truth,
Can it be love, the care of youth?
Enters the salon, with a shiver,
Flies to the house, through the hall,
He hardly speaks. In his dejection,
How? From that wilderness…’ He uses,
In agitation, his lorgnette,
Onegin’s tongue-tied to the last,
The ode shows pure nobility
There they sit, the minutes pass,
To gaze at will, in her direction,
Treads the skies.’ Well now, I might
But she had heard of them a dozen
But the cold, aloof Princess,
While he is lost in reflection:
Haunted by one thought, his stare
Meets her calm untroubled air.
But through some process of osmosis,
Enter the Prince, to interrupt
This unrewarding tête à tête, 
Change of tone, starts to relate
Of wit, froth, free of affectation, 
Tales from their past. The guests
Talk seasoned with the salt of malice;
The simple lore of bygone days;
To the hostess they raise the chalice
What dreams or cards portend, grew pale
But you, disciple of the Muse,
Neither pedantic nor intense,
By afternoon, of seeing you,
Here was fashion’s finest bloom,
With too much life or wit, but charm. 
His dreams disturb him sadly, sweetly,
In bonnets, roses, all the rage,
St Petersburg’s high society,
The faces seen in every room,
The dullards we deem necessary;
Women of a certain age,
Restless till the morning light.
By the lake I’ll walk, the chime
Uncomfortable, unsmiling pearls;
Here an ambassador conveying
The gist of some great state affair,
There an old head of scented hair,
The wit of former days displaying,
Subtle, acute, and, in a word,
By the serpent who’ll deceive,
By the will of Zeus the Just.
Here, one who’d aim an epigram
Caricaturing him, Sen-Pri!
For that evening. ‘She’ll be there…!
He pens a swift, polite reply.
His memoirs to an empty coppice,
I’ll go, I’ll go’ – At once, with care,
Recalling all the good he did,
Retired, to write undying verse,
There a minister, out of office,
Tend his roses, and rehearse,
What ails him? Is it some strange coal
Rise from the shore, and soar away.
Startling the wild ducks till they
Though silent on the bad he hid. 
For his estate, where she, bereft,
Here too was Prolasov, so stunted
In his soul, so worthless he
That your pencils were all blunted,
He wakes to a solicitation,
The Prince has sent an invitation
Of my verse by the water’s side
Her prudent husband, swiftly left
Call to each other in the yards,
Can scarcely wait for night to fall.
Can you, with such a heart and mind,
Not she? It is though…no…and yet…
So thin, and sparse, and so empty,
To his Lovelace, Grandison, 
Carried in dream to that land where
Drawn to the tree, and what sours,
Each day he stands beside her coach,
Else paradise is no paradise.
For a swift interchange of looks,
For what we see, not what is ours?
The unapproachable goddess,
Of our proud imperial Neva.
O Human Race! Why such a fever
Forbidden fruit before our eyes,
Seduced like our ancestor Eve, 
Gazing on the moon, its light,
Had betrayed itself in youth,
His mind ignores all self-reproach,
How changed now our Tatyana is!
How perfectly she plays her role!
How well she carries out the duties
Humbly, with him, on life’s way.
Its violent storms, are blessed by it,
Rank demands, achieves its goal!
Who in this calm, majestic creature,
The power to rule, in every feature,
Would recognise the tender girl?
Yet he’d once set her heart awhirl!
Then, till Morpheus brought her rest,
She’d dream of him at dead of night,
Longing to journey, day by day,
Virginal hope within her breast,
Sad rustling fills the woodland ways,
To love the ages must submit;
Yet my Eugene’s preoccupation
With all their mysteries laid bare;
Yet virgin hearts, despite its pain,
Kept the books, and shaved the hair
Passion’s tempests will renew,
Quite dumb, because so tightly-laced;
More often now the sun is shrouded;
Of wild geese, in noisy clans, 
Passion’s death-march brings tears:
The shy, sweet girl whose adoration
Was with Tatyana, not, in truth,
Southward stretch the caravans
Of levied serfs, bathed Saturday,
Turning meadowland to marsh,
Stripping forests, fierce and harsh.
Oh Brenta! No: yet I’ll rejoice
Over-starched and rather brazen,
Tanya, like a lovesick boy;
Who’s affectation caused occasion
Shorter and shorter grow the days,
Pickled mushrooms for the winter,
Waves of the distant Adriatic,
China and bronzes fill the table,
Closes the tale, before it’s ceased,
His pleasure merely to assist:
On her shoulders, adjust the furs,
Or with a burning hand touch hers,
Congratulate ourselves. Hurray!
Part liveried ranks, to bring relief,
Make way, retrieve a handkerchief.
Curbs the flames with which I’m cursed.
She disregards him utterly,
Whatever he may say or do, 
Demanded my full attention.
With guests, may speak a word or two,
Or bow to him, make distant mention,
Or simply pay him no attention;
Doctors, they cry: the best by far,
So frowned on in society.
Onegin begins to languish,
She seems to neither see nor care,
He’s pining, with heart laid bare,
Faithfully follow in your footsteps;
Flares in her face, those eyes ablaze,
They say in turn’s the nearest spa.
Follows her from door to door,
Yet he stays; readier, it appears
To make an end, than take the waters;
For Eugene, falls from her lips,
He valued such things little, rightly;
Go riding on the empty steppe?
He pens, though she seems uncaring,
Here is his letter, word for word.
His illness makes him more daring, 
Hopes she’ll warm, if he insists,
I foresee all: how I’ll annoy
Is bare, inevitably bores, the reason:
Was driven, in no uncertain fashion,
It’s as monotonous as home. 
Let her pursue her own sweet way,
ONEGIN’S LETTER TO TATYANA
Prompting your malicious laughter?
You deeply, by my sad confession:
What bitter scorn in your expression,
To ease the pain his love incurred.
Sliding on ice, with his worn shoe,
Trusted her himself, quite clearly,
Silent, chattering, as you please,
Though she’s unmoved by it, no tears
When we met, long ago, by chance,
Walk? The countryside you roam
Yet her spouse loved her dearly,
With some fair Venetian face,
For teeth or nails, both are served, 
For you, still drag myself about,
From the heart’s true paradise;
Lensky’s luckless sacrifice…
I tore my heart away, completely
God! How I erred, and am undone!
I dared not trust the circumstance,
I thought that freedom and rest
Were substitutes for happiness. 
No, to be with you constantly;
Refused to give rein to affection;
Goes somehow, tomorrow too,
Grow paler, and then die….what bliss!
Your slightest glance; your smiling lips;
To listen to you, and to know
Your perfection in all this;
To suffer at your feet and so
He read, at random, as before;
That, I’m denied; and, simply
He sends a second and a third,
Though precious time goes swiftly,
How proud the glance you’ll employ!
These hours that fate has plotted,
With all their weary weight allotted.
My days are numbered, yet it’s true,
If I were certain at first light,
I could endure until the night.
I fear lest this humble prayer,
I surrender, and my fate.
May be construed by your mind
In pain and sorrow, at your feet,
In the graveyard’s darkest corner.
In whatever way words can entreat –
To suffer passion’s parching thirst, 
To burn – while reason forcefully
It had trapped him, like a mourner
To long to fall there, clasp your knees, 
Lest the world, her spouse, should guess
Pour out complaints, confessions, pleas,
Take it then, since you’re so eager!)
Life without albums, waists, Pauline,
To don a mask, in form and speech,
Make conversation, and to teach
The eye to hides its joyfulness…! 
Yet so be it: here I wait:
The fight is done, the sword is still,
More deeply in his lunacy,
My liberty, though tedious, too,
Open myself to endless blame,
There’s no response. He writes another;
Reveal my soul, and thereafter
Still no reply, then he finds her,
The echo of midwinter’s cold!
Truly his star is in eclipse! 
What can I hope for? With what aim
There’s Dominique de Pradt, or Scott.
You don’t care for them a lot?
Peacefully their lives progress,
My lips from hers will softly prove
While he devours her with his gaze.
No mark of tears? …No trace, no sign!
On his own madness, to immerse
Only what anger may define.
Once more rejects society,
That; and perhaps a hidden fear,
That folly, that past tenderness.
Though seeing the tenderness in you,
Triumphant you’ll see winter through.
Some decent neighbouring family
Sometimes they receive as guests,
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
Scissors with straight blades and curved.
Of despair, burn flattery’s incense,
Through the fashionable scene,
Where French sounds were de rigeur,
To know its beauty, be its friend.
Where Italy’s gold nights descend,
Steel combs, files in various guises,
Or frighten with a glance or two
Danced the mazurka deftly too,
Manzoni, Herder, and Chamfort,
De Staël, Bichat, and Tissot;
Read Bayle, as well, the arch-sceptic;
Read Fontenelle. He was eclectic,
Read, thus, sundry Russians still,
Drowned in snow, and buried deep.
E sempre bene, gentlemen. 
Of criticism, most profound,
Ready to praise us or to hound,
Where I’m told I’m nothing new,
Though once they sang my gifted pen:
Epiphany they celebrated,
Eugene lies, his fall complete;
What then? Though his eyes moved on,
His thoughts were lingering elsewhere,
Wish, dream, regret for what was gone,
His mind a whirl, he wandered there.
Eugene, I first saw your face;
He read, by an inner light,
Those with other meaning. He
Immersed his soul there, utterly:
In mysterious legends that told
Of deep passions, ancient, dark;
Inconsequential dreams; the arc
Of rumours, threats: prophetic, old;
Some long fairytale’s wild nonsense
Or a young girl’s letter, pure, intense.
Eugene, do you see in memory
While reading, on both mind and feeling,
Slumber steals, the years roll back; 
Now imagination’s dealing
Its brightly-coloured faro pack.
He sees a youth there, far below,
Farewell. Whatever it was you sought,
Hears, and then his heart is chilled,
Words echoing there: Well and Killed. 
Farwell to my strange hero, too,
Malicious cowards, slanderous players,
For a few books, a garden glade,
Old companions’ cruelties;
Gazing at the glowing pyre,
She – always she, behind the glass...!
He almost lost his mind, indeed,
Plunged endlessly in reverie,
The clock strikes ten. He’s at the door;
His daily round I’ll describe here,
Not exactly what we need!
In a corner, by the fire,
Magnetism or hypnosis,
My foolish pupil now knew
The way to turn a verse or two;
Onegin counts the hours, once more; 
Or Idol mio, till his review
Or slipper fuelled the flames anew.
Softly humming: Benedetta
Your forbearance now I’ll crave,
Would soon settle his new wife)
Or far sounds rise, as wheels meet
The days flashed by ­– and with the sun
The winter snows soon disappeared.
For idleness and sense to waste –
Nor went mad, or died, as feared.
The spring revived him. He hastened
To leave his place of hibernation,
The double windows, cosy fire,
Snug as a marmot might desire;
For long? …Forever. For we,
For my Tatyana, long forsaken…
Where on blue ice-floes light-beams play,
For my dreams, my tender years
Grey trampled slush; yet, what’s his whim? 
Where are the horses taking him?
For the simple churchyard there,
Reader, you’ve guessed, as I suspected,
For timber and tallow, quickly paid,
To his Tatyana, though rejected,
My incorrigible, never weary,
Makes his way, with corpselike face,
Into the lobby’s empty space,
The next room too; unoccupied,
How skilfully he’d feign the new,
French he spoke and wrote with ease,
The princess, in a simple dress,
Pale, alone, and in distress;
Her cheek rests on her hand, she cries,
Reading a letter, silently,
Her tears falling constantly.
Friend or foe, it matters naught,
Who could have seen her silent pain,
That instant, and not recognise,
In the princess, Tanya plain:
Poor Tanya, in her new disguise?
In wild repentance at her feet
Her quiet gaze does not falter.
She shudders, silent, yet her eyes
Show neither anger nor surprise,
His dumb remorse; an open book
His frail appearance, wasted look,
Motionless and nerveless hand,
She sees him clear; and other days
Return; that innocent, her dream,
Or from greedy lips, remove her
Rise, now, this merits explanation.
She does not try to raise the man,
Strange presentiments: even the cat
That washed its face, and purred,
The lengthy silence ends, refined
What passes now through her mind?
Warning her of this and that,
Who keep my pyramid from rust,
Whose kind hand will smooth like down,
Friends and enemies from afar
That moment ­– how should we forget? –
There in the garden, where we met,
Where, held in the hands of destiny,
You preached: the strong to the weak?
Today, it is my turn to speak.’
From the whispering tongues, allow,
I freeze – my God! – to think of you,
I thank you now, with all my soul…’
In the old way, maids foretelling
Issued from your heart’s redoubt?
What reply? A harsh rejection.
Is it not so? That girl’s affection,
Was no surprise: so simple, true?
In the silent misty evening,
That heartless icy look of yours,
Lecturing me, so fiercely…yet,
You bear no blame. I can’t forget,
You acted rightly, in my cause,
To what their mistresses were fated,
Pronouncing: ‘He was a poet!’
Some fool may yet achieve a trope,
Nature’s debt already paid.
Garbed to the modern taste,
I offered little interest…ah,
Why must you pursue me now?
Why now pay me these attentions?
Glistening, an obedient tear!
Of our world grant me honour; 
My husband’s wound, his valour,
Make him a favourite at Court?
Glowing, in a crystal sphere,
Would condemn me in that place,
God grant you found a trifle here,
Would give you notoriety,
In the eyes of our society?’
Have wandered far enough, for me, 
Ignorance of the pain I feel!
Your poor Tanya, even now,
Then know: I’d rather suffer all;
That bitter anger, that cold brow;
Were it within my power,
Than the insults of this hour,
Your passion, letters and your tears.
In that face Eugene was keen
You showed respect then…now you kneel.
Why now? What brings you to my feet?
What foolishness, and what complete
There was no trace to be seen,
While she gazes at the cover!
Her Grandison, adept at cards,
Her eyelids showed not a quiver
His glance now bold, with tender art,
This tinsel of a life I hate,
The homage rank may engender,
This house, the soirées, my whole fate,  
What are they? I could dispense,
In an instant, with this pretence,
The noise, the glare, the masquerade,
His heart the tempest now stripped bare,
Our old modest dwelling, where,
So far away in time and space,
I beg you, go: and you’ll defend
I know, her honour with your own;
The place where my poor nurse was laid
To rest, beneath the woodland shade.’
I love you (why should I pretend?)
I married. And now, you must leave her,
So near! ...But now my destiny
Is carved in stone, immutable.
Perhaps I turned away too swiftly,
Nor did her troubled lips compress.
That I should wed…all paths from there
Seemed as one to poor Tatyana…
To the object of his adoration,
Truly! She didn’t even shiver,
Turn pale, or blush with distress, 
Your pride; these feelings shown.
Who reads the works of his creation,
Of whom she could not get her fill,
Leaning, musing pensively,
On the granite parapet,
She left, yet still Eugene stood there,
That fashion or luxury supplies,
The useful arts, can devise,
Roguish, coy, or see appear,
His hair cut neatly a la mode,
Tatyana’s husband looms near,
So, Reader, in that sorry state,
I leave my hero, to his fate:
I must abandon him for now.
How many days since her form,
I’ve found all that a poet desires,
Through this wide world. We bow,
In this casual set of verses:
Let us part now amicably,
Lets him draw her to dry land,
Reader, whoever you may be,
She stumbles on – and yet, beware,
Reader, you’d know what they say?
Since it’s late, and travel quickly:
Like a shadow, or a wife. 
Some wild past your heart rehearses,
Or perhaps a pleasant rest, 
My little book. In you, I feel,
Or some mistake grammatical,
Prompt a dream, or article;
To raise a smile, provoke a tear,
Something of what these stanzas tell. 
With starlit crowns; the track is gone;
Oh, this stupid countryside!
So: Madame Larina, while we ride,
Sounds more sweetly in the silence,
Since with a cab hired from the stand,
Sweet conversation that inspires,
That’s not the business we’ve in hand,
The careful spouse as much his man,
Were ever dearest friends of his,
Onegin, he was deemed by many
Inheriting, as sole relation,
My Tanya’s, appeared to me,
Veiled in mist, as in a dream, 
Into society he rode.
Its free flow still dark, unclear.
Thinking with a mournful sigh,
To bring his medicine unsmiling,
Insomnia, pale inspiration,
To whom the first few lines were read…
Unripe powers, or fading art,
Might have been turned to better ends –
Some are no more, as Saadi said.
Receive my thanks, and grateful dues,
The house was filled with commotion,
You’re curious for every detail,
Though young he learnt the way to stir
We’ve all acquired some education
Such our young dog’s meditation,
The bitter record of the heart.
The intellect’s cold observation,
Reflecting you, your noble dreams,
Dedication
Eugene Onegin
