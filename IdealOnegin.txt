A ballroom tyrant by the door
Abandoned for barbaric tongues,
Abandoned, the fields are silent,
Abandoning all true discretion,
A birthday party, here a ball.
A bit of this a bit of that,
A black-cowled monk, or if a hare
A block of snow will slowly glide,
Abodes of demons and of monsters;
A bon mot, with a fierce headache,

A bottle of sparkling wine,
A bottle pops; the wine now flows
About the volume’s true content,
About the weather, crops, and cattle…’ 
About time too! (I hear you say?)
Above ‘t(out) à v(ous), Annette’;
A branch leans down to snag her hair,
A brief snow-flurry spirals by,
A brilliant azure lights the sky,
Absorbed by remorse at things done
A caricature he next designed
A casual guest comes, sits and plays,
Accounts, drink, rage, the gloomy evening,
A charming portrait, yes, indeed,
A cherub, motionless, red-faced,
Achieved in her conceited look,
Achieving peace at last, and plenty;
A child’s slumber, or the moon,
A classicist, and pedant both,
A clever scheme of rural song,
A clue the index may afford her,
A creature heartless and amoral;
Across a gentlemanly space,
Across the literary stack,
A cure for my sad history,
Adam Smith was more his tome, where
A dandy, ensign in the Guards. 
A dark-eyed, white-skinned maid to keep
A dark reproach in every word.
Adding to albums of that kind,
A decent sort, though yet conceding
A delicate and trembling ridge,
A devil in pride, or yet an angel,
A distant strand of singing soars;
Administering the same corrections
Admire it, as if he were trying.
Admire the dense and noisy hum,
Adorns the table, boiling hot,
A drop of that dark fragrant stream;
A duel in the morning light, 
Advice both sensible and sound.
A dwarf who sports a tail; and that,
A faithful shadow, nothing more;
A fashionable glossary,
A fatal wound on some young friend,
(A feeling tortuous and tenacious:
A few steps from eternity,
A fierce desire to love and live?
A fiery will, a lively mind,
A fisherman’s fire: Tanya there,
A flower in deepest grass, alone,
A flow of silhouetted stills,
A foreign tongue it is that slips,
A fresh demon will inhabit
A friend of truth: a poet then.
A frightful witch with a goatee;

After such unremitting labour, 
A full three hours at least he’d spend
A future world with their caress. 
Again, a simple touch amazes,
Again imagination blazes,
Against intruders; furiously,
Again the pain, again love’s art! 
A gateway in a lane: at last!
Age demands prose for a time,
Age drives away the urchin, rhyme.
A General’s, noble, to my mind.
A girl will often change her lover,

A glimpse of life, or a jest,
A glittering stream beside a garden!
A great fat goose her red-webbed feet
‘A habit Lensky.’ ‘You find life boring,
A harmless, and delightful dream. 
‘Ah, at last!’ their hostess cries,
A haze of tears to cloud her eyes.
‘Ah, boredom, that’s what’s bad, my friend.’
‘Ah, but the elegy’s so light,
Ah, but then the whirl of fashion,
Ah, friends! How often joyous, too,
Ah, little feet where do you stand?
Ah, now but you’re up already!
‘Ah, Nurse, Nurse, I’m so unhappy,
A horn rings out, enchanted dream,
A Horse Guard’s spurs go jingling,
A host of nymphs around her, so
A household, a neglected wife,
‘Ah, Tanya, dear! Come, let me see –
Ah, they made me long despair
Ah well, to them may God be kind! 
Ah, what treasures Fate has taken!

Alas! From life’s dark furrows rise
Alas! Her friend of many a day,
Alas! Her look seems to hold

Alas, not difficult to guess!
Alas, now some are distant,

Alas, poor Yorick!’ he lamented,
Alas! Young girls are faithless ever,

A lexicon, a parody?
A liar yet, Lubov Petrovna;
A light dinner, not too pensive,
Alight in his cold, torpid soul?
A lily in the morning dew,
A little note then for her hero
A little pale and thin, but all
Alive again on memory’s stream.
A lively horse and responsive,
All are watching in surprise,
All around her, glittering white. 
All attentive, or just mumble! 
All chained to their pre-conception,
19.All evening Lensky was distracted,
All forgotten, and rehearse
All glad at heart to take their rest,
29.All her daily walks grow longer,
All he sees and hears, he notes;
All hope, all you who enter here.’
All hope is lost! He leaves: a curse
All in good time, trust me, I’ll try
All in our sage’s cell appears
All is over: to your will
All is silent, shuttered, still,
All is so pale and colourless,
All is still, only the guards
All is well: our moments fly,
All life, before us, seemed so fair. 
All make for home in the end,
All mankind’s malicious ways
All memory of him swiftly fled
All night, barely a foot away!
All objects spoke mysteriously,
All of that ancient rhetoric,
All pierced her to the core; and then
57.All poets, it seems to me,
All rise; he rushes to the door. 
All serious effort – no words flow,
All, sombrely, surrounding them.
2.All’s peaceful; in the parlour, vying
All spiteful gossip, yet his tools
All’s tedium, madness, and pretence
All still the same as we recall;
All such is alien to my mind;
All that I knew forgotten. Yes,
All that is glad, lives, never mine –
All that Onegin knew about her…
All that, to sate boundless caprice,
All that was settled long ago.
All that we now find absurd.
All that you sincerely meant
All the British Muse’s lumber
All their romance seen dimly 
All the neighbours were seduced.
All the noise of talk and laughter;
All the sad morning of his life,
All the shades of wintry pleasure;
All the trouble, and the pain,
All the world seems lost in sleep,
All things declare, and magically,
All this fresh to Onegin, till
All this is out of fashion now,
All those foreign words and phrases.
All those torments that oppress,
All was as grist to his mill;
All went smoothly from that day,
Almanacs; and journals, too,
Almost embraced pure poetry –
A London dandy safely classed
Alone, alone it seemed for good!
4.Alone amongst his new possessions,
Alone and sad, my darling Tanya,
Alone, engrossed in calculation;
Alone, in silence. The moon sheds light.
Alone together, at his shout.
Alone, to Lensky’s taste inclined.
Alone, where the meadow gleams
Along the fragile bridge’s length.
Along the Neva in his sleigh,
Along the rows of darkened houses,
Along the streets where snow-melt lies,
Along with Cottin’s work Malvina,
A love that’s innocent, sincere.
Although inseparable I’ve found
Although we welcome you, so gladly.
Always faithful to the end,
Always gave three balls a year
23.Always humble, always truthful,
Always partly out of tune,
Always smiling as the dawn,
Always the Frenchman, had to bring
Always the one pure constant dream,
Always together, in her room
Always unjustly persecuted,
A mason, and forever drinking,
A mazurka holds the crowd;
A meaning that her heart obeyed. 
A melancholy oddity,
A memory to the mind may bring
A mere five hundred years) our roads
A mild rebuke, a sharp remark,
A mirror on the moon, but learns
A mirror underneath the pillow,
A missive that declares his passion.
Am I unworthy, you would find.
A mob-cap and a quilted gown. 
A moment since, imagination
A moment: that was all it took.
Among sad cliffs for preference.
Among the guests; they swiftly twirl; 
Among them all, confusion reigns,
Among the many doomed to go
Among the snowdrifts, roars
Among the wives and daughters seen,
A monstrous crew, imagine it!
A Muscovite in Childe Harold’s cloak,
An Academician in a bonnet!
An ace of clubs at twenty paces,
An Almanack, of year eight vintage:
An ancient house or one new-born
An author of romantic fiction
An awkward guest at such a feast,
Ancestral portraits stretched for miles,
And a host of younger girls,
And a house – where shadows pass,
And all is brilliance at the ball.
And all the dreams the heart holds fast.
And all their echoes false to us,
And all their voices now combine
And all the world lies still, below,
And all this world dark below?
And all you ladies sentimental –
And always, in the final chapter,
And an old man whom she’d ignored
And anticipate his funeral.
And argue whether it shows wit.
And as a rule despised each face,
And as for our young votaress, 
And as for trouble…well, I’m done for,
And as it ends, with this confession,
And ask your Muse to take a bow,
And at long last claim attention,
And at the table, dinner served,
And awkwardness, barely replies,
And be as happy…as I could!
And beside her, her Eugene –
And bony finger, point her out;
And boxed you ears, a time or two!
And brought the visit to a close;
And by Heaven has been blessed,
And calms his fears with a kiss,
And captive girls by the Salgira,
And carpeted voluptuousness.
And choke him with a tragedy,
And church-crosses black with daws.
And clog the Larin’s steps and drive,
And cloistered life Onegin led.
And creditors had him at bay,
And curious as young girls are,
And dangle the careless lorgnette.
And dark beneath the branches’ cover,
And dark hair hanging to his shoulder.
And daze the eyes of innocence,
And died just before his dinner.
And died with all he owed unmet.
And dined with her déshabillé.
And draw to us a handsome lad,
And Dunya sits to pour the tea, 
And earn a luncheon with them both;
And eighteen nags now appear.
And end, himself, in the mire,
And even there, at last, vice wins. 
And everything Parisian taste,
And, exiled for that very thing
And fail to offer a word, to make
5.And far away from our great city,
And farewell you, my true ideal,
And far niente is my law.
And fed you cake!’ Tanya’s barely listening
And finds Tatyana, no one with her;
And fled through the fields, that too
And Flyanov, toss and turn on chairs,
13.And for a long while Tanya stood
And for you, knowledgeable race,
And full of grief that he was dead,
And gave his neighbour’s ribs a dig.
And gazing in adoration see
And gladly lived a life of debt
And glasses, tall, with narrow waist,
And godly folk will institute,
And guaranteed not to alarm,
And halts: what’s this, before his eyes?
42.‘And he…but we’ve time tomorrow
And, heedless of the cold, she turns
And he must never mention me…’ –
And here is autumn golden-browed,
And here’s Gvozdin, squire and farmer,
18.‘And here with our neighbour, Lensky,
And her youthful charms, elated,
And he then rapidly skedaddled,
And hides it suddenly from view,
And high time to be on his way.
And hungry wolves, that loom
And hurriedly, before it died,
And, if permitted, by and by,
And ignominiously repeat
And I lament my former sorrow. 
And I’ll mention here, in passing,
And I loved you; ah, what answer,
And in a sing-song voice confide, 
And in Caucasian gorges, join me,
And in deep perplexity,
And indignation’s icy passion,
And in his hut, with a will,
And in his silent room recalls,
And in spring, in hidden vales,
And, in the aching heart, set free
And in the bath-house, in a trice
And in the fierce storm and strife,
And, in vain tedium, I play out
And I – perhaps, far from the light,
And its attendant rivulets gleam,
23And I’ve seen other beauties too
And I –with a sigh, I confess –
And jealously the world afford
And jealousy, you understand,
And kept dull boredom far away –
And knew by heart, or thought he did,
And know the answer to my query:
And Knyazhnin’s imitative rhymes. 
And learned life’s bland reality:
And leaves them in the gloomy light
And let the proud and mocking gaze
And life a transient mystery:
And life’s horizons broad as yet,
And listen to the forest news,
And looked a poet, to the letter,
And lost in endless reverie;
And lost in misty moonlight all
And, mist on meadows everywhere,
And my Eugene was free at last,
And my mother-in-law, bless her ways,
35.And my Onegin? Half-asleep
And never asked her husband first.
And never bothered for a moment
And never breathe a word of it,
And never fully plumb its measure.
And no confusion, no compassion?
And not abandon me to fate. 
And not forget the pistol-case.
And not the least ink-stain around,
And now, at this very moment,
55.And now I must congratulate
And now, recalls past enemies,
And now the north wind drives the cloud,
And of his every caprice,
And one bright morning, off he flies,
And on the first page, for inspection:
And on the rustic bench’s gleam
And our Katenin moreover
And passed the time as people do,
And pass sarcastic judgement on her.
And Petushkov – spurned him too.
(And philosophic sentiment
And pierce the very heart of it.
And played an honourable role,
And played a wholly different role,
And portrayed love’s happiness,
And praised to the skies above,
And prettier then, too, no doubt,
And promise you, most sincerely,
And pulls aside the curtain;
And putting out a trembling hand 
And question-marks in several books.
And quiet her voice: ‘Have done,
And recreate the magic hoard,
10.And rightly so: For sitting sternly 
And rose from the bench again,
And rosy as Aurora when
And ruled him like an autocrat.
And sage of inns, a philanderer;
And sang me to church. What a pair!’
And scratch her neck, and stubbornly
And, seated quietly by my side,
And seems an utter alien here,
10.And sees herself the heroine
And seething abyss at her feet
And sets her down upon the floor.
‘And she’s?’ – ‘A Larin, and a dear.’
And she, whose lines I sketched
And since he never read a page,
And sings, and plaits a lime-bark shoe.
And slips away, as chance may please,
And slowly they both made their way
And, smiling, room’s made for the pair.
36.And so grew old, like all things mortal,
And so in careless rapture I
24.And so my Tanya began
12.And soon our Olga’s chiming voice
And soon reveal their better nature,
And so she wrote in French of course …
And sound in every Russian heart!
And so we part, again farewell!
And speaks to them, as to old friends.
And spirit finds creative fire.
And spoke as if he scarcely cared,
And still transparent to the eye
17.And stranger still, behold a spider
And Strasbourg pies, renowned in fable;
And stride in arches every way,
And substituted light quit-rent,
And swore in deepening irritation,
And Tanya all attention, keen
And Tanya alone, in secret, pined;
And Tanya, full of terror, wakes…!
5. ‘And tell me, which was Tatyana?’
And that fugitive from the world,
And that inscription on their brow,
And the crowd, all the rabble…’
And the edge of earth grows brightly,
And the ex-councillor Flyanov,
And the flame in her cheek.
And the hypocrisy, demeaning,
And the moon’s celestial light,
And then, a sudden thought shines clear:
And then demand an expression
And then demands the cotillion.
And then? Full of confusion,
And then he’ll dress, may write a letter, a
And then, if suddenly she spied
And then Onegin approached her,
And then one wet shoe disappears
And then…our hearts we must restrain,
And then she squeaks (Oh Lord, above!)
And then such things are like a cancer!
And then, to part us utterly…
‘And then what became of Olga?
And then, while you were gone,
And the peerless Grandison,
And, there? .....Around a table sit
And there a seasoned traveller,
And therefore my fall from grace
And there grew wild as they: all sense,
50.And there, where bold Melpomene,
29.And there you’ll see, without a doubt,
And the servants’ quarters! No,
And the shame dishonour brought,
And the waywardness of passion,
And the young city lady, down
And thirty years the prize I earn?
‘And this is my own Tatyana.’ – 
And though a womaniser fine,
And though they’re filled with contradiction,
And time gives nurture to the thing.
And tiresome pleasures full of strife.
And to deep emotion yields:
And to delight the sensual
And to the revels and the feast,
And to those seductive nights,
And truffles, luxuries of youth,
And turning morning into night
And wake her many and many a time,
And waking early, Tanya found,
And was wept for by his neighbours,
And we can all display éclat,
And we….don’t shine in any way,
And whatever stirs her soul,
And what of her sister, where is she?
And when a meteor crossed the sky,
And when he wanted to refer
4.And when I fled that company,
And when nurse had collected
And where he spent those icy days,
And why? What am I striving for?
And will be faithful to my vow.’
And with a smile, and an abrupt
And with Olga, lost in dream;
And with southern oceans nigh
And with what storms his body shook!
And wore, her last defences down,
2.And yet how sad you seem to me,
And yet, I am another’s now,
And yet it’s one I can’t translate;
And yet I was amazed to find
And yet my Onegin’s etched.
And yet with a pretended coldness
And you, familiar woods I love,
And you (its rhyme forever) youth?
And you my constant care, yes you
5.And you, my dear indulgent reader,
And you, my youthful inspiration,
And your reproach repay in kind.
And you, the bright celestial dreams,
A needle, never once excelled,
An embittered mind that seethes
An empty phantom, or a joke,
A new face claims our attention.
An exile, and bound to none,
A nightingale, from woodland gloom
An illustrator’s dream, and more,
An instant hails the entrechat,
An ironic stanza of how he’s smitten.
A noisy crowd; and fighting, larking,
Another captured her attention,
Another care, profounder pain,
Another day, and still no sign,
34.Another day I bring to mind!
Another door, he flings it wide,
Another dream, and one more chill,
Another? ....No, no there’s none
Another’s joy, another’s sorrow,
Another star had its ascension,
Anticipating future bliss.
Any fish to make a match;
Anywhere, start, end, or middle,
A paragon of pure perfection.
A parody of southern winter,
A past acquaintance, and relation.
A pedant in the details, no less. 
A Petersburg ball, in all its glory,
24.A pipe of amber from Istanbul,
A pleasant-natured lad but wild.
A poem in cantos, twenty-five! 
A poet? No, he wasn’t one,
A poor second-hand illustration,
Appears consumptive in his anguish.
Applies himself with diligent
(A predilection we should praise).
A priceless treasure, here to stir
A prize which Tatyana bought
A profile of contemporary man
A prophet in the wilderness,
Apuleius won my praise,
A pulse, the blood’s living heat,
A pure devotion to the good
A puzzle that seduced, it seems.
A quiet retreat from the storm.
A rainbow glitter on the snow.
Ardent and eccentric thought,
Are all such things quite alien
Are all your relations well?
Are born a people to whom death brings no pain.
Are enchanting, friends, I find! 
Are heard, perverse, insatiate,
Aren’t you bored to death, dear God,
Are only instruments and tools;
Are raised again, the work’s completed.
Are subject to infatuations,
Are treated in the kindest way
Are you as you were? Have new
Are you then my guardian angel,
A roaring in her ears, eyes dazed…
A roast-beef, rare, adorns the table,
A role as husband, father; found
Around the hour the French name
Arresting her against her will.
Arrive, and greeted heartily,
Arrived, asks Guillot if he will
Arrive to laughter, schoolboy jests,
As affected, strange and vicious,
As, after winter’s icy blast,
As a girl’s thoughts, unaffected,
As an air from Weber’s Freischütz played,
As any passing simpleton. 
As ardent glances swiftly fly
As a recluse, idle, gloomy,
As a storm will often shroud
A satanic monstrosity,
As at the feast he seemed to be?
As a veteran, solemn faced,
As being entre chien et loup,’
A scholar, in a yellow shawl,
As conversation slowly dies,
A scribbled, and mis-spelt, rendition.
As dazzling as a flashing sabre,
A second Chadayev, my Yevgeny,
A second quarrel, then they sigh,
A seething torrent, foaming, pours
44.As emptiness possessed his soul,
A sensitive and handsome face.
A serving-lad hands round the cream.
As for finding ancient treasure
As for Lensky’s fate, you know,
As for me….they’re not my ways,
As for Tanya this one chimes:
As giddy youth, the dancers fly,
A shadow, pale. Ah, for one line!
As heaven dictates. You’ll love again.
As he lowers horns, stubbornly,
A shepherd’s pipe wakes the dale.
As his horses plough the dust,
As his watch’s chimes repeat
As if a cold, an icy hand
As if a lightning bolt had struck.
12.As if before some mournful parting,
As if to raise a magic charm
A sight of the true original,
A simple letter, free of guile,
A simple Russian family
A simple Russian scene, by night,
A single boat with outspread oars
A single image as it were:
33.As in the olden days they flowed,
16.As it grows dusk he takes a sleigh:
As it is, I ask forgiveness, 
Askance his opera-glass now centres
Asked her name, straightened his wig,
A skeleton haughtily in place;
Asks him, ‘yesterday? Disturbed,
Asks Larina, curious,
Asleep it seems on melting snow,
As lightning in his visage plays.
As long as, on credit, they’d guarantee,
As meek, as deaf, who, nothing new,
As much as in Moscow, the proud.
As much the victim of his fun,
As Muraviev, our Yevgeny.
As, my Onegin, I do you.
As neighbouring families arrive,
A snowdrift shifts, a shaggy bear,
A soldier-husband, a campaign.
A song we love, a merry song,
A soul for passion’s fires designed,
A soul so trusting, in that fashion.
A spirit tuned to all creation?
A sprinkling of commonsense,
As pure as winter’s ice, as rigid,
As saturnine romanticism. 
As servants of the Muse have acted,
As she might on any other day. 
As some deceit the eye lays bare,
As some old squire cuts a dash,
As some suspicious aged devil,
As soon as daybreak will allow,
As stern, as distant, and as frigid.
As such fine mansions ought to be,
As tedious phantoms? Is that spleen,
As the fields by springtime rain:
As the foolish moon in space,
As the half-light turns to dawn. 
(As their master told them to,
As the shadows slowly wane,
As the stars’ choir fades away,
As they composed them long ago…’
As they fly like arrows towards home. 
As though she had a private sorrow’
As though we can never treat
A stoneware jug of cider handy,
‘A story, Tanya? In my time,
As to where he’ll spend his evening.  
A street-light, though inferior. 
As verse inside him burns and glows,
A swarm of beauties, cool betrayers;
(As was the case in times gone by,
As well-read, but opinionated,
As wife and mother, faithfully. 
As yet unknown, I held you dear,
As you leave the village, a place
A table’s readied for the pair;
At any more demanding book. 
At dark fields, mirroring her cares. 
At dinner, when intoxicated. 
A tedious season we await,
Ate, drank, then left, solemnly
At eighteen years he had the power,
A tenderness. Whether he meant
At every single thing he hated,
At fifty tolerably debt-free,
At first I wished to stay quite silent,
5.At first the neighbours visited,
At first they make but little sense, 
At first they seemed indifferent
At forty suffer from the gout,
At heart a simple innocent,
A thing the winter cannot tame;
At his neighbour’s grave, and truly
At home all day, more or less,
27.At home he renders it apparent
20.At home, his pistols are inspected
12.At home, impatient, breathing fire,
At home receives him equably,
At home they’re already waiting,
A thought took root in her heart,
At ill-bred men he deprecated,
A time when, pursued by spleen
At last he stirs, sits up in bed
At last it’s over, now it’s supper,
At last near dawn, his weary head
41.At last she gave a sudden sigh,
At least a pretence of empathy,
At least, denoting our regard,
At least their words seeming more,
At lies with which the press was rife,
At more beefsteak and Strasbourg pie
At my mistress’s feet lying,
At nothing, pathway, lake, or copse,
A tomb, a Cyprian shrine to love,
At once he’s tortured by remorse,
At one of whom his recollection
A trouble-maker, and malicious;
44.A true Childe Harold, my Onegin
A Tsimlyansky, for a toast;
At some soirée where…not a word,
At some vile novel’s reputation,
At such and such a date, and age;
At tag in the meadows, say,
At tea too sweet, banal Madame,
Attention to her album: find,
At that time, and retired from view,
At the altar, head bowed down,
At the campaign, the snow, his wife.
40.At the commencement of my story
At the gate, says her goodbyes, 
At the Larins had produced
– ‘At the Larins.’ – ‘How very odd.
At the least unguarded moment.
At the mazurka, floors would quake,
At the moon’s meaning, each chill phase;
At the same hour’s sweet caress,
At the table takes her place,
At the turning of the years,
At the unexpected move he’d made,
At the window, read it through.
At this Zaretsky promptly rose,
At those sisters’ royal decoration,
At times be silent, then in sport
At Whitsuntide, their tears they’d shed
Aunts and mothers keeping house,
Aurora, rosy-fingered, brings
Autumn’s gales reveal time’s treason,
A victim, decked out for the gale… 
A village, a house among the trees,
A vital force flows from the root,
Awaits us all, at the end,
Await the touch, involuntary,
Awakes a young man’s loyalty,
A walk beside the lonely lake,
A walk indeed would suit me best,
23. A wandering pedlar had brought
Aware that Lensky and Eugene,
A whiteness covering the ground:
A windmill dances a wild jig,
A wintry carpet deep and light,
A wreath once swayed to and fro.
Back to his regiment, her choice
46.Backward, I glance. Farewell the glade,
Bank and brake, sweet waters flow –
Baratynsky
Baratynsky, were you with me now,
Bark, laugh, whistle, sing and screech,
Bathed in the moon’s enchanted glow.
Be amused by our vices;
Bear, bridge, darkness, fir and forest
Beard, tufted tail, sharp gleaming claw,
Beat the servant girls and cursed,
Became a bore, it seemed, unending.
Be careful of your horses step,
Because her simplicity, it seems,
Because, rich, noble, the conventions
Because she’s trusting, and honest
Been fluent in her native tongue. 
Been spared this deep inquietude,
Before blood left its scarlet stain,
Before he’s drained life to the lees,
Before I meditate the rest. 
Before the mirror, then would leave
Before the young man’s death, he’d dine,
Before, to prompt her minstrelsy,
Before you, let him now advance.
Before you, simply to excite,
Began an aimless wandering,
Beguiles, with its seductive lies.
Behind a door cheers resound,
Behind the mill, while there, apart,
Behind the strange bed’s silken drapes,
Behind the stump of a nearby tree
Be in your presence, hear you speak,
Believe all things are for the best:
Believe me (conscience is my guide)
Believes completely in her dreams?
Be more amused by something light.
Beneath his cherries and acacias,
Beneath the table’s damask gloss,
Beneath this stone, rests quietly here. 
Benediction we drank deep!
Beseech, elicit true confession,
Beside a river. On every side,
Beside fair Nina Voronskaya,
Besides’ ­– he thought – ‘the die is cast,
Besides, my friend, you’re invited,
Beside some lines still incomplete.
19.Besides, the enthusiasm of youth
Besides they are so pure, so pious,
Beside that nameless river shore,
Beside the fire a table’s laid,
Beside the mill, and at first light,
Beside which Chateaubriand’s pale,
Be so enslaved, so cruel, so blind?’ 
Betrayed, a husband from a novel, 
Betray me, while you poor thing
Betrays no trace of coquetry,
Betrothed though against her will:
Better than one dour modern lyric?’ –
Better to hurry to the ball,
Between the lines that met his sight,
16.Between them every disputation
Beyond my importunate lyre,
Beyond the voiceless boundary,
Birch, and lime, and aspen bare,
Bits of Northern poetry
Bitten by the snake, Memory,
Blessed is he…although she might
10.Blessed is he, who in youth was young,
Blessed is he, who leaves the feast,
Blessed our first poor offerings;
Blessed the day of toil and care,
Blessed, the man who lives a fiction,
Blessed the tomb’s darkness there.’
Blessed with skill, the Muses’ art
Blessing Russia’s ruts and ditches
Blinded, dazed by sombre joys,
Blind with that mist that veils the eye. 
Blood from his wound is streaming,
Blown by the wind, in swift decay.
Blows and howls – and presently,
Blows chill; the sleeping groves, around
Blue columns rising over folk,
Boldly replacing its belle Nina,
Boldly trusting in your honour…’
Books of sentimental verse,
Boos Cleopatra, hisses Phaedra,
Bordeaux, I tell the waiter:
Bored by Theocritus and Homer,
Bored with leisure in the end,
Borne away to change at home. 
Born, in a garret, of a liar
Borrow your bewitching skill,
(Both are perhaps synonymous)
Both had known Fate’s passing fashion,
Both had known the play of passion
Both had wearied of the game, 
Both his father and his mother…
Both of them would make him yawn.
Both the sisters, by the hand,
45.Bottles of Cliquot or Moët,
Bowed to each acquaintance new,
Bows to friends, then views the action,
Breaks the lilacs, hurrying on,
Breathing one thing, loving one thing,
Breathing on the icy pane,
Breathing the frosted air of nights;
Breath of spring caress my face,
Breeds ducks and geese, while at his knee
Breeds fear of reconciliation.  
Brief as your footprints on the grass.
Brighter than finest parquet gleams
Bring fresh beauty to the view –
Bringing boredom, anguish, then,
Bringing breakfast on a tray,
Bringing flowers, and ripening fruit.
Bringing the science of persuasion
‘Bring me ink and paper, draw
Brooding silently, she’ll ride,
Browsed through Gibbon and Rousseau,
Brushes of thirty different sizes,
Bullets are loaded, weapons cocked,
Buoyant as hope, that soars forever;
Burned in my dear Tanya’s heart!
Burning suddenly with shame,
But all eyes were turned, I own,
But as, at the back porch, was saddled
But as for genius, if any,
34.But as it is, our roads are bad;
But back now to our theme: Madame,
But broods on what he must ignore:
But by breakfast, dinner, tea; 
But by rule, and he was loath
But – could not. She asked a question:
But dinner’s served, the couples pair,
But drawing-room pre-occupation
But empty fancy’s vain distraction
But enough, enough: you’ve paid
27.But even in her earliest days
But Fate took Eugene by the hand
But first what hopes you’ll cherish,
But for his wit, which he rated,
But from our friends, may God preserve us!
But gaze at him, as she surveys…
But, God, what tedium to sample
But hear my confession through,
But he is stubborn and persists,
But her mounting trepidation
24.But he’s in error; our Yevgeny
32.But hush! You hear? Our sternest critic
But if you knew this agony:
But in parentheses I’ll mention,
But in the end came to prefer
But in the late and barren season,
But it grows late; the wind as well
But I was mute, foolish in the game.
But kept the juiciest stories ever
But later found it re-assuring,
13.But Lensky, lacking the desire
But, lighted by Diana’s gleam,
But, listen, Lensky, when shall I see
But madden me, spur me to depart.
But merely pleasant conversation,
17.But most of all they talked of passions,
But…my mother’s tears, her prayer
But never a fresh thought all day,
But no, beneath Finland’s skies,
But no! – Down the steps, as ever,
45.But none of them have changed a bit,
But no! Not a bit of it, he’s gone.’ –
43.But not quite yet. Although I dearly
But not without a blush, I fear.
But now a clink of spurs, and here
25.But now, from out the vales of morning
But now her reason and her will,
But now my friends I often hear,
12.But now our minds are somewhat cloudy,
‘But now, too late: the moment’s past…
But often to the window glued
51.But of those, good friends, insistent,
‘But oh, the expense, not like here!’ ­–
But one and all, in truth, agree
But only a yard, strange, immense,
But only, it seems, from my days
4.But on, on with my story!
But our Onegin’s off to roam,
3.But, perhaps this winter scene
But Petersburg that restless heap
But regardless of such passion,
But scarcely comprehends their art,
But she had heard of them a dozen
But she takes fright, my Tatyana,
But soon we saw our plans unravel,
But still found nothing in his head,
But still the pounding in her ears,
But suddenly a draught of air
40.But summer in our northern clime,
But swiftly, at her nervous cry,
22.But Tanya, seeming not to hear,
But Tanya’s spirit is unmoved,
But Tanya wrote it all so badly,
But Tatyana, scarcely hears
But the cold, aloof Princess,
But the end to this encounter,
But then at eighteen that’s the rule;
But then Larina crawled along;
23.But, the outcome of their meeting?
But the pleasantest thing of all
But there’s a risk in such fiction,
But there was no capitulation,
But the world’s scornful expectation
But they’re replete from their labour,
But through some process of osmosis,
But was dear Yevgeny content
But we must to the garden go,
But we’ve so many neighbours, why
36-37.But, what of Onegin? True, dear Reader!
But what on earth is one to do?
31.But where, in what deserted strand
‘But where on earth,’ with surprise,
But who, in this select assembly,
9.- 'But why berate him so severely,
11.But wonders come to her in dreams:
But you, Bordeaux, are a friend
But you, disciple of the Muse,
But you, the beautiful, and dear,
But you, the men in wedded bliss,
30.But you, the suspect volumes bound,
43-44.Buyanov, my lively ‘cousin’ leads
Buyanov’s asked her: she refused.
By affectation – not the rest. 
By afternoon, of seeing you,
By a pillar, between two aunts, 
By a single thought oppressed:
By both friend and enemy, 
By candle-light she’d rise and dress. 
21.By chance, I have the lines, unfinished,
By critics of the higher arts,
By fate’s implacable decree.
By Fyodor Tolstoy, decorated
By his better half is lying.
By his children and his wife.
By me alone his soul was moved!”…?
By melancholy tears oppressed,
By nervous hands, mind half-obeyed. 
By Olga, and as one enraptured
By Olga and her lover Lensky.
By Olga, though yet not bereft
By our heroine sits, spell-bound.
Byron
Byron was there – and novels, one
By self-satisfied nonentity;
By slight of hand, or by some jest,
By slyly thieving one or two;
By some careless lad for sport,
By that window: now I pray
By the entrance step, or on it,
‘By the fireplace, there’s his chair,
By the lake I’ll walk, the chime
By the nose; deceive the clever;
By the serpent who’ll deceive,
By the third, field, wood, and hill,
By the will of Zeus the Just.
By this cruel thirst to kill each other.
By winter her mute heart’s oppressed.
By Yevgeny not for his heart
By your good and virtuous wife,
Calashes, broughams, and kibitkas.
Called by his neighbour, forcefully.
Calling Moscow to its labours;
Call Praskovya, Pauline, and would
Calls her welcome from the sofa;
Calls out his name…uselessly:
Call to each other in the yards,
Calm, her gestures unobtrusive,
Can it be love, the care of youth?
Can it be true, and not a mere
Can it be true, that crown at last
Can it be true there’s no return?
Cannot but despise it all,
Cannot quite eclipse her neighbour.
Can scarcely wait for night to fall.
Can this girl who’s scarcely yet
20.Can this really be Tatyana,
‘Can you really love the younger?’
Can you, with such a heart and mind,
Captivated by its essence; 
Cards, or glance, or sweet sigh’s power,
Careless of fame, the brittle.
Caricaturing him, Sen-Pri!
Carried away by his brave calling,
Carried in dream to that land where
Carry the weapons, as before,
Castigated ruthlessly
Cast-iron spans will leap the river,
Cast-iron statue which they pass,
Catch the first flush of emotion,
Cattle grazing in the clover,
Ceased to count the summer days,
Chairs, chests, and watering-cans,
Challenge that, but here’s the thing,
Champagne is like a mistress,
Changed places: there, you have the gist,
Change of tone, starts to relate

Charms us with sublime invention,
Checked the sun, his watch – and went!
Cheerfully, I’d give my all
Chest puffed out, content in mind.
Childe Harold, bigot, or Quaker,
Childhood mischief, petty glories
Child, is there something you need?’
China and bronzes fill the table,
Christmas comes, joys unfold,
Clarissa, Julie, or Delphine;
Clasps in her hand a book, in French.
Clatters his chair against the floor;
Clear and serene his tune,
‘Clear the road!’ loud sings the cry,
Closes the tale, before it’s ceased,
Cock their pistols, and let fly,
Cold, darkly threatening, and dour!
Cold yawns with their icy train.
Come away, my pretty ones,
Come, borrow from me, within reason.’ 
Come in, warm yourself, my dear,
Come to me, come: yours, to the end!...’
‘Come to my golden chamber, love!’
Come you maidens, pretty maidens,
Commands us to reject for good,
Comment; now a question-mark.
Comparing notes, like circling sharks,
9. Compassion, and indignation,
Compelling truth, or illustration,
Complete with wide-brimmed Bolivar,
Conceal his hopes, feign jealousy,
Concealing its reality. 
Conceit of elegiac verse,
Conceive it. No one here to cherish
Concerning harvesting, or wine,
Confess it now, behold: the truth.
Congratulate ourselves. Hurray!
Considered as the art of love,
Considered it a certain thing.
Considering himself, so placed,
Considers vulgar. (Pardon me…
Consoled her and brought relief.
Consumptive, four years past, and failing.
Content forever with their life,
Content with life, took a stance,
Contests their entry in a breath;
Conveyed a hint, a mere suggestion,
Cosmopolitan, patriot,
Cossacks, Bokharans, merchants,
Cottin’s Malek-Adhel, de Krudener’s de Linar,
Could alter Lensky’s loyal soul,
13.‘Could I happily circumscribe
17.‘Could I, perhaps, just see inside?’
Could kindly fate for me prescribe
Could never yet conceal a thing,
Could not conceive how haughty Grimm
Could they not speak and smile again,
Could you conceive those golden curls,
Couples sweeping wildly by;
Cousin, it’s like a dream to me…
Covered by the powdery snow;
Covered with sheets of downy gleam;
Crawling to him on her knees,
Cries: ‘Cease your endless squawking,
Cries, the clash of glasses, all
(Critics stern, acute as any)
Crossed her path, in panicked flight,
Crunching over morning snow.
Crushed by adolescent gloom,
Cunningly begin a quarrel,
Curbs the flames with which I’m cursed.
Curses their hours of idleness,
(Cursing the hour of his birth),
Custom demands. They sat and sat,
Custom is a tyrant, and prevails.
Damask in the drawing-room,
Danced the mazurka deftly too,
Dared clean his nails in front of him,
Darling, how long can you stay here?’
41.Dawn breaks in a chilly gloom,
Day and night, till our next meeting.
Days and nights an anguished joy.
Deaf, voiceless, never to reply,
Dealt with her sympathetically;
Dealt you by the cruel Fates?
– ‘Dear Cousin!’ – ‘Sit: it’s like a page
Dear liberty and leisure.
Dear Lord, enough, enough! Have pity!
‘Dear, you can’t be well,’ replies,
Deceit, and slander, rings and tears,
Deceived – a welcome rest would take. 
Dedication
Deepening the garden’s shade,
Deep in all things economic
Deep in the country, far from town,
6.Deep in the hill-encircled valley,
Deep, in the translucent night
Deep in the woods, than do as bidden.
Deep in thought, above the board,
Defying then the dread Apollo,
Delayed though, temporarily,
Demanded my full attention.
Denizen of the wings, he’ll fly
Departs the room, yet asks Anisya
Derzhavin, at the grave’s dark sill,
Derzhavin he who tuned his art
Derzhavin, lingering here a while
Despite all efforts, or aspire
Despite her beauty bright as fire,
Despite the lack of streets and yards,
Despite the pallor languor gives,
De Staël, Bichat, and Tissot;
Detesting all the social whirl,
32.Diana’s breast or Flora’s cheek,
Did all that was required to please.
Didelot too is quite the bore.’
Did full justice to the rest,
Did I so long with painful ardour
Didn’t they mutilate our speech,
Did she pine for him?’ She’ll wonder;
Did the singer sadly mourn
Dimitriev
Dimitry Larin, a poor sinner,
Discarding friends to win the same;
Dispassionately gave a sigh;
Dispel my doubts, I am blind,
Displays a hopeless egotism
Display their vests, or form a set,
10.Distanced from the claims of beauty,
Distant hopes will sometimes start:
Diverted by the welcome sound,
Diviner, and Chaldean sage,
Doctors, and weeping women, dead!
Doctors, they cry: the best by far,
Dog-eared, with the cover bare,
Do I hear once more your choir sing?
Don his spectacles to see
Don’t be cross with me, my sweet,
Don’t disavow it, I find here,
– ‘Don’t think…truly…don’t accuse me…
‘Do tell me, Prince, now, to whom,
Doubt is over, they will fight,
Dowagers smiled as she passed by;
Do we recall those doomed to burn,
Down he’ll slip, and throw you too.
Down the streets where evening drowses,
Down to the flooded fields below.
Do you now voice your thoughts aloud?
Do you recall your Grandison?’
Doze on the fur coats in the lobby,
Drains his glass then, Heavens above,
Drawn by post-horses, or your own,
Drawn to the tree, and what sours,
Dreaming, understanding nothing,
Dreams of a country, lost too soon,
Dressed at dawn, she gives a sigh,
Driven by its laws and fashions,
Driven by the springtime sun,
Drive on! And, to resume our story,
Drives home again, where that night
Drives home, preferring his own bed. 
Drive the dogs off, to ensure
Drowned in snow, and buried deep.
Drunk as an owl, a Frenchman’s prize,
Ducked the moralizing sermons,
Due rank and custom they observed.
37.Dusk falls, the samovar is gleaming
15.Dusk falls. The sky is dark. The river
Each day he stands beside her coach,
Each falling there as they form
Each figment of imagination,
Each had acted like a brother,
Each man to his own ideas,
Each object is, to her notion,
Each one tried to catch her eye;
Each with a pistol in his hand,
Early, the will to rule appears,
Earn me the first fruits of fame,
Eat, drink, yawn; ill, and stout,
Eavesdropper, don’t you dare
Eccentric, eloquent, at bay!
Echoing down the years. The poet
Echoing in its emptiness:
36.Eight times our heroes at their whist 
Eight years he killed, hour by hour,
Elegy penned a madrigal. 
Elle étoit fille, elle étoit amoureuse.
Eloquence to inspire the bolder,
Else paradise is no paradise.
Embellished by their jealousies.
Emotion’s only fit for fools.
Enchanted me: I often sat
Enchantment fails such men as he,
Enchantment, with an unspoiled mind.
Encouraged by his Olga’s smile,
Endeared himself more readily 
Ended on the Black Sea shore,
Endless bottles of sparkling wine
Endless future tribulation.
Enlightenment has been a waste
Enough! Again, my soul is pure;
Enough, it’s all the same, you know,
Enough. It’s high time that instead,
Enough. It’s time for that letter,
Enough, it’s time now to move on!’
Enough. My shoulder’s from the plough!
Enough of my loquacious lyre,
Enough of praise though for the proud,
Enough to make the ballroom shake,
Enriched by meditative dream.
Entered, together, arm in arm,
Enters softly and disturbs her,
Enters. The room is gyring,
Enters the salon, with a shiver,
Enters the study silently,
23.Enter the Prince, to interrupt
Enthral like Martin Zadeka,
Entirely of his vengeful pleasure;
Epigram in all its coarseness,
Epiphany they celebrated,
E sempre bene, gentlemen. 
Estimable Reader: come,
‘Eugene! Ah!’ – Light as a wraith
Eugene came to apologise,
Eugene continues to lie
Eugene, do you see in memory
Eugene flings wide the door, reveals
Eugene had found, with what word
Eugene, I first saw your face;
43.‘Eugene, I was so much younger,
Eugene lies, his fall complete;
Eugene more tolerant than most,
1.Eugene, now Vladimir had left,
﻿Eugene Onegin
Eugene Onegin, born and raised
Eugene stares down at Lensky,
Eugene stood there uneasily,
Even as man of honour, features:
Even in books, virtue’s dowdy, 
Even in the midst of terror.
Even now I hear him say,
Even the fashion page, could not
Even their slanders meaningless,
Even though he cannot know it,
Ever desire’s habitual stream,
Ever habitual pain and grief,
Ever Love’s most alluring vial,
Every dawn produces more
Every day, both near and far;
Every salon high and handsome,
Every writer’s fine creation,
Exhausted by regret, and rhyme,
Exhausted by society,
Exhaust him, now, let him doubt,
Exits, calls loudly for his horse,
Experienced but the one reaction.
Extends, and tries the gleaming ice,
Eyes downcast, till her languor,
Eyes misted, as they sped away…
Fables: Zadeka though was better;
Faced with her open, tender gaze,
Faced with her soul’s bright clarity! …
Faced with her sweet simplicity, 
Failed to join the shameless guild,
Faithfully follow in your footsteps;
Faithlessness was not amusing
Falling ill like that, and dying;
Falls silent. Only heir, heiress,
(Fancies, fables of the ages,
Fang and tusk and blood-stained jaw,
Fare thee well!  and if for ever,
Farewell, lonely sanctuaries.’
Farewell nature, my joy, adieu;
Farewell! No lingering here,
‘Farewell now, you haunts of peace,
Farewell. Whatever it was you sought,
‘Farewell, you valleys, peaceful, dear,
Far from Italy’s allure. 
Far into the silent hollows;
Far more enchanting, to my mind.
Far now from praise, he sighs,
Far off a choir of girls sing
Far off, invades her every sense.
Far off…the Muse followed after.
Farwell beauty of skies above;
50.Farwell to my strange hero, too,
Farwell to you, my freedom, too!
49.Fashionable Record Office clerks,
Fashionable rings they need.
Fashionable shops, and yards,
Fate had granted, Napoleon, 
Father of many, still unwed; 
Fault was charming, though it grated?
Fearing all the barbs of envy,
Featherbeds, cockerels in cages,
Felitsa’s virtues set to rhyme –
Fell at a friend’s hand! You’ll discover,
Felt inexpressible elation,
Fevered rhyme on such a theme
Fierce jealousy, sad separation,
Filled with grace and innocence,
Filled with sweet passion, pensive shade,
19.Filled with terror, see her try
Fill him with dissatisfaction,
Filling the silences with gossip:
Find fresh powers; Imagination,
Finding all jealousy absurd –
Finding him sensible, yet smart.
Finding it small deprivation,
Find life a ritual, dull and dead,
Finds a deeper fascination,
Finds delight to come, or doom;
Finds her Ideal, and fitfully
Find that youthful folly real,
Fine inns too, all along the route.
Fine…They’re all well, and send you
Fine verses on his Finnish Maid.
Fired by longing, circumstance,
Firmly founded on the land,
First: he’d erred in his reaction
First Madame, you understand,
First rouse his vanity and let
Fit only for our grandsire’s stage,
Five more paces now they take;
Five versts from Krasnogorye,
Fizzing, and amidst the talk,
Flares in her face, those eyes ablaze,
Flashes by, and in no time
Flattered her, smiled, ingratiated
Flattery soon soothed her pain,
Flaxen hair, all gleaming, too,
Fleeing at the sign of danger,
Flee the metropolis, its bother,
Flies to the house, through the hall,
Flings wide the door, he holds a sock
Float in a gondola’s embrace,
56.Flowers, love, fields, and idleness,
Flows in turbid streams that run
Fluff her hair to suit, dear creature,
Flushed and satisfied. Poor Lensky
Flute, bassoon, are gladly heard.
Folksongs, and the wedding chorals, 
Follow in Petrarch’s steps, seem
Follows her from door to door,
Follows the promptings of her heart?
Follow the bland crowd that bores us,
Fonvizin shone there, Freedom’s lover,
Foot it sweetly, now and neatly,
Foot it sweetly, on the grass!
For a few books, a garden glade,
For all of that monotonous breed
For all of that now, have we not?
For all those years long sped by?
For all your gifts, even the least,
For a noisy world of vanities…
For a swift interchange of looks,
Forbidden fruit before our eyes,
For boredom, and hypocrisy,
For Boston, claiming the old-fashioned,
For but a moment, mind and sense –
For capture again, should that arise,
For careless youth’s without regret,
Forced between her lips, will serve
Forced to forgo that sweet tomorrow,
Force you to lie awake, and mumble. 
For conversation’s art created.
For Eugene, falls from her lips,
Forever now, they separate.
For fortune-telling they prepare
For forty years had berated
Forgetting friends and city life,
Forgetting Hymen’s gifts, vexation,
Forgive me: I’ve loved from the start
Forgo the city’s ceaseless drone.
For here, elated by the prizes
For he was victim from his youth
For him alone, the eternal lover;
For his estate, where she, bereft,
For his love, his latest verses?
For idleness and sense to waste –
For I stopped sinning long ago.
For it’s our idol, honour’s mainspring,
For long? …Forever. For we,
For my dreams, my tender years
For my Tatyana, long forsaken…
For my Zaretsky, as I said,
For reasons that I’ll indicate.
For rural life, and memory turns
For rural silence, where the lyre
For several days thereafter she
For social worlds beyond her years,
For some malignant blow of fate. 
For Tanya, a song that children sing,
For teeth or nails, both are served, 
For that evening. ‘She’ll be there…!
For that fatal sustenance,
For the Father of the Universe.
For the passions of the heart;
For the simple churchyard there,
For the summer, bored with town,
For the waltz, and stepping lightly;
For timber and tallow, quickly paid,
For trousers, dress-coat, or for vest;
54.For two days it was all quite new,
12.For two long minutes neither spoke,
For what we see, not what is ours?
For whom among that jealous crowd,
For whom her heart was made to burn,
For whom, to expiate our crimes,
3.For wilful passion was my measure,
For your enlightenment, to spell
For your pleasure, so be brave.
For you, still drag myself about,
Found another, served at last,
Found his place, or, martyred shade,
Found refuge from the storm of life,
Found, without rank, career, or wife,
Found your fame, perhaps amazed,
Four fatal steps, to kill or maim.
Frantic and quivering, caught
Free, and in the flower of youth, 
Free Chapter Five from more digression.
Freed from the burdens of the past.
33.Freed now of its dampened cork,
Freedom’s champion, ever strong
Freezing cold, a menu’s put
French he spoke and wrote with ease,
French still entrances in a sentence,
Fresh dreams will replace the last,
Fresh hope on which my heart is fed?
Fresh linen: take time by the ears;
Friend of my heart, eternal friend,
Friend or foe, it matters naught,
Friends and enemies from afar
Friends and friendship were confusing,
36.Friends, for the poet now you sorrow,
14.Friendship like that’s to us unknown,
Friends of Ruslan and Ludmila,
Frightening a timid love away
From a novel, yet here you are…!’ –
From dawn, his only occupation,
From every pleasure he retreated,
From foes we can ourselves protect:
From Griboedov took Chatzky’s cue,
From here, plunged in thought, he saw
From his estate, perhaps: and then
From his uncle’s man, to say
From inside there’s noise and clatter;
From loge or parterre, saw her pass.
From memories of long ago,
From misty Germany he brought
From my words take warning due,
From passing thought, enduring rhyme,
From porch to yard, in a moment,
From Romulus to our own day,
From that dark forbidding face;
From the avenging bullet; now,
From the cradle, the slow stream
From the field, with hushed tones.
9/10.From the first, he’d spread confusion,
29.From the first she craved romances,
From the fog, the horse can scent
From the ground floor to the upper,
From the heart’s true paradise;
From the local camp, what rapture!
1.From the neighbouring hills, the snow
From the roof, face, shoulders, breast.
From the start, had fired his blood. 
From the stove on which it sat.
From the whispering tongues, allow,
From the yard the serf-boys fly,
From two to thirty, in a row;
 42.Frost already, frozen noses,
Frosted glass; and far hills gleaming;
Frost’s silver powders on it lie.
Full of innocence and sweetness.   
Full of life’s sincerest passions,
Full of love’s foolishness, again
Funds for a Moscow winter found.
Gain trust, or cause pure disillusion,
Galloping onwards at my side!
Gambler-in-chief, an intimate
26.Garbed to the modern taste,
Garden, roofs, and fences, pale;
Gave himself to it instead,
Gazes at the empty garden,
Gazes, painfully, around her;
Gazes unseeing at the swirl,
Gazing at the glowing pyre,
Gazing on the moon, its light,
Generally their conversation
Gentle Reader: low and mean,
Girls prefer The Kitten’s Wedding.
Gives us the first snow’s measure,
Glad now that his former ways
Glancing round to seek her Lensky,
Glancing stealthily at the door. 
17.Glass on glass to drench the heat
Glide smoothly over lacquered boards,
Glimpsing from the distant field
Glistening, an obedient tear!
Glittering, the first winter snow
Glowing, in a crystal sphere,
Glutton, bribe-taker, and prankster.
Go, arm in arm to table, where
God be thanked, some imitation,
God grant you found a trifle here,
God! How I erred, and am undone!
God knows whom and what; your art,
God sent you to me, I avow,
God’s servant and a brigadier,
Goes somehow, tomorrow too,
Goes to raid nature’s treasury.
Golden cornfields, flowery meadows,
Golden springtime of my youth?
Go, little book: find Neva then,
Gone, with the fashions we abuse,
Go now, take this note of mine.’ –
Good and evil, what science taught,
Goodbye, Eugene, I must be leaving.’
‘Goodness how the years speed by!’
Go riding on the empty steppe?
Go seeking quarrels, take offence,
Grandmamma and grandpapa
Grants an indifferent crowd her art;
Grateful, in my heart of hearts,
Great shelves of books he read and read
Greet her enthusiastically,
Greets the new season, brightly.
Grey trampled slush; yet, what’s his whim? 
Griboyedov
Gripped by feelings of remorse,
Grip the reins, and from her hair
Grow paler, and then die….what bliss!
Grows recklessly and fills the room,
Guarding with unconscious art
Guard your daughters most severely,
Guests bow politely at the door,
Guests squeeze up to let them in,
Guillot, his French valet, appears;
Gvozdin, Buyanov, Petushkov,
Habit brought her quiet content,
Habit joy’s surrogate, heaven sent. 
32.Habit soothed her agony,
Habitually, between their lips.
Habit would cool my love for you.
Had betrayed itself in youth,
Had called to show their true devotion,
Had fired this heart, pure inspiration,
Had gradually overwhelmed him,
Had gripped her heart, as if a black
Had long bored Eugene to distraction,
Had merely challenged him to fight.
Had never, even when young,
Had opened… ‘Yet the death is sweet
Had she found the word at last?
25.Had she solved the conundrum,
Had Tanya had the power to see
Had to present his hero as
Had vanished long ago, and yet
Half-jesting, or with true intent;
Handsome, young, a Kantian,
Happier he who never knew them,
Happy is he who can employ
Happy the one who has passed by,
Has met his fate before his time,
Has never with letters been allied. 
Has opened up his serving flap.
25.Hastily he rings; the servant,
Hates the tedium of their visit,
Hating all this litigation,
16.Haunted by love’s pain, Tatyana,
Haunted by one thought, his stare
Have had sufficient time to act
Have played a rubber; and eight times 
Have that to think, and think, upon,
Have wandered far enough, for me, 
Having escaped those stormy regions
Heads, in profile, edges crop, 
He almost lost his mind, indeed,
Health, life’s beauty, sweetness past,
Heaped with snow; glittering there
Hearing fresh whispers sigh and call? 
Hearing his last failing breath,
Hearing in the crowd, and after,
Hearing the same outworn objections,
He arrives, the cork pops, heaven!
Hears, and then his heart is chilled,
He, as friend in need, you’ll gather,
Heated by the warmth of spring,
He breathes the air of freedom, at
He brings’ – she murmurs – ‘and I lack
He chose – a more than worthy goal,
He condemned himself severely:
He curses woman’s reckless course,
He’d addressed a multitude
He’d agreed, what found absurd.
He dances, nonchalantly guiding
He darns, old spectacles adorn
He’d called, was pleasant company;
He’d dare to toy with a tress,
He’d feared lest his opponent might
He’d led a good and simple life,
He’d made pencil marks, his soul
He’d make conversation with her,
He’d no desire to dig the dust
He’d not allow a man to die
He dreams of, in his exultation:
He drew a mourning veil of black.
He drinks – the creatures howl and swill,
He dropped his gaze, began to hate
He’d scorned, for her lack of art,
He’d sit here of a Sunday,
He’d wander through a drawing room,
Heedless of their friendly clapping;
Heels, and leaps, and long moustache,
Heels pounding on the wood below,
He ends the struggle and has done. 
He enters…ah, what news, hurray,
He even felt the urge to yawn,
He flees the ball, and finds his bed,
He followed still, for customs sake.
He found it in some dusty album
He frowns – and everyone is still;
He gave heart and soul expression,
He gave his arm: downcast, head bent,
He gently yielded to its ways,
He had the gift of easy chatter,
He hardly speaks. In his dejection,
He hated girls’ neurotic fears;
15.He heard our Lensky with a smile,
He hoped Olga and I would wed,
He is a man of honour too.’
He knew enough I would allow
7.He lacked the passion and desire
He laughs – and they all fall about,
He leaves again, and home has gone,
He leaves a tender verse behind,
21.He leaves the ball, and pensively
He left his village and his land, 
He liked debate, to point a moral,
He’ll have time still for the latter.
He loves you….like your dearest kin!
He made his name by simply falling: 
11.He might have spoken openly,
He never managed to disgrace,
18.He nods – and there’s a mighty shout;
He notes the boxes, serried places,
He noticed nothing, did not care.
He offers her a long curved claw,
He ought to do so – will your soul
He pens a swift, polite reply.
He pens, though she seems uncaring,
He plunged, head first, into the stream,
‘He promised he’d come, today,
He pursues, or something more,
He pushes through the open door,
Her aching heart can find no rest. 
Her breast heaves, her cheeks aflame,
Her cheek rests on her hand, she cries,
Her confidante, her own sweet dove,
Her days and nights alone, through life,
26.Her dearest friend was reverie,
Her description here from any
Her distress, her hidden passion,
24.Her dream is deeply worrying her, 
Her dreams had long since set her yearning,
Here acknowledged dandies strut
35.He read, at random, as before;
He read, by an inner light,
Here an ambassador conveying
Here a village, there another,
Here comes Zaretsky, colour higher,
Here is his letter, word for word.
Here no conscience, there no sense,
25.Here, one who’d aim an epigram
Here’s a hut, to which he dashes, 
Here’s an end to all their jokes ­–
Here’s a wood: in beauty, pines
Here’s his study, he’d recline
Here’s the first use of it made
Here’s to my dear friend, Bordeaux! 
		    ‘Here’s Yevgeny!
26.Here too was Prolasov, so stunted
24.Here was fashion’s finest bloom,
26.Here, with his wife, a portly charmer,
Here without an ounce of bother,
Her eyelids showed not a quiver
Her eyes are clouded, filled with tears,
Her eyes are opened, it is he!
Her eyes: the bell towers chime,
‘Here, young Vladimir Lensky lies,
6.Her face grew pale, and she’d quiver.
Her face, like one about to die.
Her face possessed his memory,
Her failure too to comprehend;
Her father, mother, not her way
Her father saw no harm in reading,
Her former room she can’t forget.
Her. Galloping, closer it appears.
Her garden, her romantic novels,
Her Grandison, adept at cards,
Her great delight, she loved them so,
Her handkerchief is next to go;
Her head above the silk inclined,
Her head sinks, the stars grow older,
38.Her heartache feels like some disease,
Her heart still, in it’s agony,
Her idol, someone to admire,
Her little finger’s traced, I see,
Her love thus, since, despite its force,
Her manner is as self-contained,
27.Her mother always valued greatly
Her mother’s scarcely reconciled:
Her neck, her throat, her shoulder!
Her night-dress slips from her shoulder, 
Her nightmare seeming to portray,
Her nod as quiet and restrained. 
He rode in his lover’s direction;
Her overflowing heart, love’s gleam.
Her pallor, and her melancholy,  
Her plight indeed is most forlorn;
Her prudent husband, swiftly left
Her quiet gaze does not falter.
Her sad eyes tearful and bright,
Her same friend Monsieur Finemouche,
Her secret wish to it confide. 
Herself not certain of the reason)
Her silent passion’s more intense,
Her sing-song voice in gossip blend,
24.Her sister’s name was…Tatyana,
Her smile, her calm serenity, 
Her soul in distant regions wanders,
Her soul was waiting…but for whom?
Her spouse the club’s most loyal member,
Her tears falling constantly.
Her tender fingers never held
Her to that hellish crew – and peals
Her to the wide deserted court:
Her voice tender, sweet and low,
Her way again in soulful flight?
Her, while to her ear confiding,
Her word away, she’s pledged already
Her work the crackling firewood lights,
He’s a menace in the first degree.
10.He sang of love, to love subjected,
He sang of parting and of sorrows,
He sat down and wrote another,
He saunters on the Boulevard,
He saw as clear as the dawn,
He saw the poor girl’s quivering state,
He scrapped the old corvée, no less, 
He seems to see his Olga, bright
He sees a youth there, far below,
He sees, his heart filled with emotion,
He sends a second and a third,
He’s fooled us far too long, and so…’
He’s here, my friend, Monsieur Guillot.
He’s in, and flying to the mill.
He slept at last, but fitfully,
He’s lost: the votary of rhyme,
He’s off to Talon’s, calculating
He sought the forest’s shadowy ways,
He sought them without joy, and met
He’s pining, with heart laid bare,
He’s walking off…he’s sideways on…’
He sweetened with delightful dreams
He swims that little Hellespont,
He thought them quite innocuous,
He thought: what folly to work ill
He toppled from his Kalmuck stallion,
He trots, performs amazing feats,
He turns to go, and at the door,
He undresses; a book’s selected,
He valued such things little, rightly;
He visited at Christmas…Oh!
He waits then Lensky appears,
He waits till the mazurka’s done,
He wakes at noon, or even later,
He wakes to a solicitation,
He was her solace and delight,
51.He was loved…such his conviction,
8.He was no fool; appreciated
13.He was pursued by a vexatious
He was quite infatuated,
6.He was the practical joker, ever
He watched her as she sang and played.
He who feels, is quickly taught
He who had never once concealed
46.He who’s lived, he who’s thought
He who yawns away his life
He with lawyers round his ears,
He would neglect and then abandon.
He yawned inordinately, and so
Hidden from the world: while pale,
Him hope, deploy uncertainty,
Himself! I thought: “He’s the one,”
His beaver-collar shines away, 
His calculating neighbour though,
His character was executed
His daily round I’ll describe here,
His darling to another wed;
16.His days and dreams, what man recovers?
His dreams disturb him sadly, sweetly,
His dream’s mute monument, a link
His dressing room, I’ll not deceive,
His dumb remorse; an open book
His epigrams topped up with bile. 
His epitaph discreetly sighs:
His expression quite sincerely,
His eyes from you…there now, quickly,
His face, the princess, in the parlour,
3.His father had a fine career
His fervent dreams of liberty,
His fingers frostbitten of course,
His first pipings were of her,
His fleeting glance of tenderness;
His frail appearance, wasted look,
His friend for his own presence there, 
His friend Kaverin will be waiting.
His gaze inspired: how he could preach! –
His generous spirit still could bless
His glance now bold, with tender art,
His hair cut neatly a la mode,
His hand to Olga, leads the girl,
His happiness rare, and absolute.
48.His heart consumed with regret
His heart forever burned with rapture, 
His heart the tempest now stripped bare,
His housekeeper, gazed out the window,
His illness makes him more daring, 
His knowledge of her frailty?
His labour, torment and delight,
His leave, his heart crushed, once more,
His life till dawn the same as ever,
His lines breathe love alone, and no
His living tears obscured his glance;
His mare snorts at the snowy light,
His memoirs to an empty coppice,
His mind a whirl, he wandered there.
His mind ignores all self-reproach,
His mind, incisive, and chilly;
His mind, still malleable the while, 
His nag: it’s ill, it nearly died.
His nature, comprehend the man, 
His neighbour, caused an equal stir,
His own features in the glass;
His partnering Olga too, what sense
His pleasure merely to assist:
His presence: kindness is vexation,
His prison, loyal, prepared to fly
His rest; girl reapers, keen to slake
His rustic answer: ‘Agafon’.
His sad heart prevents all rest,
His seat at the clavichord,
His sharp claws, she lies inert,
His son was wed not long ago,’
His soul’s at peace, his bones at rest:
His spirit egotistical,
His springtime occupation bright,
His stallion, a Don thoroughbred,
His story) having killed his friend,
His taste was of a former age.
His tender look still conveyed 
His thirties, profitably wed,
His thoughts were lingering elsewhere,
His three roans in a troika. Fine,
His tributes, carefully, he fashions.
His uncle lay at death’s door, better
His uncle’s frail mortality.  
His unique eccentricity,
23.His vein then was dark and languid,
His virgin fire a living coal.
His virulence, his scorn, alight
His wastefulness and lack of plan.
His weapon spirals to the ground. 
His wedding two scant weeks ahead.
His wife was quite another one,
His youthful love, warm and tender,
20.H’m! My valued Reader, tell me,
Hoarding her treasure silently,
Holy friends of the human race
4.Homeward they go the shortest way,
Homeward, through the kitchen-garden;
Honouring, where they lay sleeping,
Hoot or argue, shout or shriek.
Hope and love and enmity,
Hopes she’ll warm, if he insists,
Horace
Horses’ hooves and human speech!
Hospitable, a family grind,
Hosts of rumours in circulation,
Hour by hour, by Olga’s beauty
Hourly it cheated us, again:
Hourly we betrayed its truth,
Hours roll on, and then, again,
Hovers, still these girls will hide
How blessed is the modern lover
How can we not love our Moscow?
28.How changed now our Tatyana is!
However I wished to prove true,
However much it takes its toll,
How? From that wilderness…’ He uses,
How heavy the emotion weighing
How I envied the waves then,
How I longed to be those seas
48.‘How is she then, your fair neighbour,
How languid was his reticence,
How long?’ – ‘Oh, two years or so.’ –
How love to the tomb will endure;
How many days since her form,
How many follies in its presence,
How often, dumb with separation,
47.How often, on a summer’s night,
How often to the Tauric shore,
How often, with some secret story
How passionate his eloquence,
How perfectly she plays her role!
How poisonous the words he used!
How proud the glance you’ll employ!
How shall I add to my confession?
11.How skilfully he’d feign the new,
How swift his letters from the heart!
‘How Tanya’s grown! Your christening
How utterly himself forgetting!
How well she carries out the duties
Humbly living out existence,
Humbly, with him, on life’s way.
31.Hysteria, fainting, tragic tears,
20.‘I am in love’ Tatyana sighs,
I await you: one look turned
I beg you, go: and you’ll defend
I beseech your protection…
I can’t count them if I try.’
I can’t go out: my legs they’re what
I can’t see it. Here’s what you’ll find 
17.‘I can’t sleep, Nurse; it’s stifling!
I can’t translate that, as I live!) 
I cede my own in deference…..
I could endure until the night.
I count myself free of its power,
I dared not trust the circumstance,
I dare to write about it so,
I’d find in you my heart’s ideal,
I’d not have known you, and thus
I’d not set the ages quarrelling. 
Idols replaced you, a worse choice?
2.‘I don’t see what’s so bad about it.’
I’d still wander those bright bowers.
I fear lest this humble prayer,
18.If he had known what agony
If I’d reserved a hope, content
If I were a poet, as you are
If I were certain at first light,
I foresee all: how I’ll annoy
I found an honest plain old dear,
I freeze – my God! – to think of you,
If she met, all unaware,
If she might return to see her,
I gave my word, and it’s my duty,
Ignorance of the pain I feel!
Ignore the tumult and the chatter’;
‘I hate the fashionable circuit,
I hear the magic of your voice!
I hold that stirrup, blessed by time,
I imagine (say, if I’m right):
I knew scores and scores, in rhyme,
I know, her honour with your own;
I know I’m slow, and short of wit,
I know it’s in your power today
I know not, yet here’s my translation,
27. I know: they’d like to force our girls
I leave my hero, to his fate:
I leave such quiet haunts as these
I liked his face, his manner too,
I live, I write but not for praise;
I’ll breathe free, take my ease
I’ll feed the proceeds of my pen.
I’ll go, I’ll go’ – At once, with care,
I’ll introduce you. Upon my life!’ –
I’ll leave the verdict up to you.’
‘I’ll not keep you, but where is it,
I’ll recall the words of longing,
14.I’ll record the honest speech
I’ll requite, with your assent:
I’ll return to him: no more!
Ill-rhymed verse, by tradition,
I’ll seize a neighbour by the collar,
I’ll set a few words echoing:
I long to sob, I long to weep…!’
I love a friendly glass, the same,
(I love such conversation too,
I love their little feet, confess   
16.I love the word, it’s so expressive,
I love youth’s frantic energy,
I love you (why should I pretend?)
I made a friend of Eugene then.
I married. And now, you must leave her,
I marvelled at their arrogance,
I’m blind to all its illusion,
Imbued with true poetic fire,
I’m grieving still, but free of tears,
‘I’m happy, am I not?’ he’d whisper.
I might commit a daring folly
I might try to tell the whole tale,
Immersed his soul there, utterly:
Immerse in, so relentlessly!
Immortals clasped in fate’s embrace,
I’m muddled now!’… ‘But Nurse, tell me,
I’m not known; he’s not about…
I’m…Nurse, you see…I’m in love.’
I’m overcome, by pity I mean;
I’m ready now for chapter two.
I must abandon him for now.
I must confess I scarcely mind
I must give her letter, error-free,
49.‘I must?’ – ‘Yes: for Tanya’s birthday.
45.‘I’m weeping….if you still recall
In a corner, by the fire,
In agitation, his lorgnette,
In all her beauty, in the night.
In all her person, form or face,
In all, not unacceptable,
In an instant, with this pretence,
In another home-made brandy,
27.In a red peruke and glasses,
In as brief a cartel as was right,
In a soft whisper, gives a moan.
In a time far, far from this,
In attic too. Eugene, instead,
In blissful sleep, it’s certain,
In bonnets, roses, all the rage,
In both our hearts a dying flame,
In chilled bottles, for the poet,
Incite two friends of his to fight,
In coaches, burdensome or light,
In confusion, thoughts perturbed.
Inconsequential dreams; the arc
Increase love’s value, find a way
29.In days of dream and ardour,
In decent company, and smile,
In deep forgetfulness, does he
Indifferently, the game is done,
Indifferent to its thoughts and passions.
Indifferent to me or you,
Indifferent to the world’s delight
Indifferent to wintry delights;
Indoors the maid will softly croon
In dreams, that fevered, solitary,
In ease and innocence I take
In every sorrow that she had,
In every vicissitude of life,
In exchange, her hopes and fears;
52.In fact he soon received a letter
In foreign gig that you employ,
Ingenious London without cease
Ingenuous naivety,
Ingenuous, trusting, earnestly
In happiness, in idle ways,
In her confusion she’d take fright,
Inheriting, as sole relation,
In her mind she writes, addresses.
In him the poet’s exaltation,
‘In his arms I played, contented,
In his deft satire: Is all you’ve read
In his face the pains of death,
In his face? Why is he present?
In his grasp, and barely breathing; 
In his memory tucked away.
In his songs kept pride of place,
In his soul, so worthless he
In his twenties, a dandy bred,
In human rights, was here all wrong. 
In it: no matter, that’s by the way).
In kerchief and quilted gown,
8. In kindred souls too he believed,
In life’s fresh glow, he still could find
In little girls of scarce thirteen?
In London sets especially,
34.In love with fame, by freedom bitten,
In masculine attire displayed
In matters of duelling reckoned
In misfortune, and in sorrow,
In Moscow, he’s near St Simeon,
In my nomadic exile, then,
In mysterious legends that told
In my thoughts, I was struck dumb.
In night’s deep silence, tells its tale. 
In noting Tanya’s distress,
Inns, there are none. In some hut,
In one a ledger taken hostage,
In Onegin’s form, and soul.  
In order to be heard more clearly.
In our regard, has left us blessed
I now enjoy composing less.
In pain and sorrow, at your feet,
In peaked cap, hair full of fluff,
In private judgement on his action,
In procession, sleigh by sleigh.
In pursuit, the dancers mingling;
In quiet, did you not speak to me,
In red night-cap, a second rider
In Richardson or in Rousseau.
In romance, the first time ever
In Russian, honouring our nation. 
In secret, or with raucous shout;
In secret regions underground,
In seduction’s net of sin. 
In sheepskin coats with scarlet sash;
In shirt and night-cap, by the door;
In silence, plan each other’s slaughter.
In silent joy, of night’s bounteous
In society’s toils that kill, 
In solitude her heart was burning, 
In some peaceful rural place!
Insomnia, pale inspiration,
In spirit, he abandons me
Instead of bristling from the start,
Instead we see, her sash untied,
In that face Eugene was keen
In that, for rustic life to pardon.
3.In that room, where the aged fellow
11.In that rural wilderness, Yevgeny
In that sweet golden youth of mine:
In the album of some sweet friend,
In the dining room downstairs;
In the doorway, idly preening,
In the end he too grew bored
In the eyes of our society?’
In the first bright flower of youth,
In the graveyard’s darkest corner.
11.In the high style of the past,
In the intellectual wilderness,
In their hours of work and leisure
In the margins where, with care,
In the morning of our days. 
In the names that we rehearse 
In the old way, maids foretelling
In the past quite frequently
In the princess, Tanya plain:
In the same lively, carefree way
In these far less tender times. 
In the silent misty evening,
In the silvery moonlight, dreams,
In the sound, and silence cold,
In the springtime on the moss,
In the water’s smooth still glass,
In the world’s noise, or solitude,
In this casual set of verses:
In this countryside of ours,
20.In this fashionable monk’s cell,
In this same romance, earlier,
1.In those old Lyceum days,
In those soft seductive glances!
In time (who knows?) I might have viewed
Into Olga’s album here,
Into society he rode.
Into the dark may have conveyed
Into the lobby’s empty space,
Into the meadows, in full bloom.
Into the pans they sift the powder,
Into the shadows, still the same,
Into verse that would amaze us,
Introduce me.’ ‘Now, you’re jesting.’
In vain, your growing appetite;
Inveterate gossip, old-time gangster:
Invite her home, too, in the end,
In whatever way words can entreat –
In wild repentance at her feet
In winter, resting on the fender,
In winter-time. Please, follow me:
In winter when the shades of night
In working something she’d designed.
In works of charity, all through
In yards and fields, loath to go.
In yesterday there is no trusting;
In your hands, my direction,
In your thoughts, you would wait,
In your traces: now youth’s done, 
I offered little interest…ah,
I once spent my sweetest days?
I only wish the words I write
I pace the shore, wait for fair weather,
I painted over this sad scene, 
I read a lot, I doze a little,
I read to my old nurse, who’ll lend
Iron virtue, chilly glance,
Is bare, inevitably bores, the reason:
Is carried far from her by fate,
Is carved in stone, immutable.
Is certainly no Grandison. 
Is: change your ways, if you’re wise.
Is doomed to feel such love, and moan:
Is dressed, undressed and dressed again?
I see your fretting’s left no trace,
Is ever-jealous, sullen, sour,
Is forced to curtsey to his bow.
Is found disturbing, on the whole, 
I share those tears that agitate:
Is hateful, in its essence, gall;
Is he as strange now as before?
Is here at last, the journey planned,
8.‘Is he the same, or has he mellowed?
Is he, who lingers silently,
Is ignorant of deceit, and still she
Is it because we’re given, clearly,
Is it not so? That girl’s affection,
Is it not true? I often heard you:
Is it not true, my fellow poet,
Is it not you, this heaven-sent
Is it the same plan he once followed,
Is merely vague, and lost in gloom.
Is now quite withered by the blast?
Is sleeping soundly: in the yard,
Is speaking? See, she’s wearing red.’ 
Is still to lull dark thoughts to sleep.
Issue an angry challenge, thinking
Issued from your heart’s redoubt?
Is the blood-sucking Vampire,
Is there a poet who rehearses
‘Is this forever’, sadly cries
Is this him, now? She cannot hear.
Is this the destiny that waits,
I still remember, and it seems
Is to aim at his pallid face
Istomina stands, serious
Is troubled by its mystery.
Is turned to silver. From it’s dream,
I suddenly beheld that view,
I suffered without hope or joy.
I surrender, and my fate.
Is where that fair song is heading:
It brought to life, instantly, 
It glows and hisses, softly steaming,
It had trapped him, like a mourner
I thank you now, with all my soul…’
I thought I’d paint (See Chapter One)
I thought Onegin’s talk disturbing
I thought that freedom and rest
It is of my young friend, I sing,
It is Yevgeny,’ sees him plain,
It, lest some sly, caustic reader,
45.I too cast off the social burden,
I too recall….ah, not for me,
I tore my heart away, completely
I travel another road, at last,
I treat it as a sacred treasure,
I tremble to re-read….must end!
It’s all too much such happiness,
It’s as monotonous as home. 
It’s been willingly displayed.
It’s bound at least to make me ill.’ 
Its brightly-coloured faro pack.
It’s clear they’re not eating them,
Its doomed despite my interdiction,
Its drum pounds fit to wake the dead.
It seemed she could barely breathe;
‘It seems he has forgotten us!’
It seems to him that it must break, 
It seems to me I’m ill, my dear,
Its fate in death’s gaping portal,
Its feasts forgotten and its speeches,
It’s for Onegin.’ – ‘Yes, indeed,
Its free flow still dark, unclear.
It’s fun, despite the pain he’s in, though
It’s Heaven’s will: I am yours. 
It’s: “I won’t.” Then on her own
It’s late; and time for him to take
– ‘It’s long since he was here though!’
Its madness and its rage to live.
It’s not my job to work them through.
It sparkles, like the Hippocrene. 
It’s peppered with them to excess,
It’s plain that he’s the master here,
33. It’s pleasant with a sharp remark
Its rich sonorous cadence rolls. 
Its sails a creaking whirligig;
Its subtle beauty lights the fires
It stifles her…her spirit yearns
It’s time to leave. Feigning calmness,
It’s time to leave this tedious shore,
‘It’s time to rise my child; it’s day:
4.It’s time, you inveterate idlers,
It’s true we don’t possess good taste,
It summons up respect, one can
Its use to date is not excessive,
Its violent storms, are blessed by it,
12.It’s wretched (I trust you’ll agree),
It was God’s will now, my Vanya,
It would be painful to depart
Ivan Petrovich, none the wiser;
I’ve bowed to classicism: you,
I’ve found all that a poet desires,
22.I’ve known women, proud and cold,
I’ve learnt the sadness of tomorrow,
44.I’ve learnt to know another longing,
I’ve not the strength for repentance,
I’ve scanned the pages of my fiction,
60.I’ve sketched the underlying plan,
I’ve wasted far too many hours,
I was bitter, he was gloomy. 
55.I was born for quiet existence
14.‘I was not born for happiness,
I was their neighbour.’ ‘Come, my friend…’
I write, my heart no longer suffers,
‘I write – what more is there to say?
Izmailov’s Journal set before her!
Jars of jam, and frying-pans,
Jealousy gone, and anger’s blaze,
Join me and my capricious Muse,
Jokes and carping comments too, 
Joy of our hours of leisure, so
Jugs of cranberry juice, all that
– ‘Just a little more, a flavour…
Just anyhow and let him lie,
Just as at wars of long ago
Just like those Van Dyck Madonnas,
Keen to avoid her, before the duel,
Kept the books, and shaved the hair
‘Killed!’…And with that stark reply,
Killed before his promise bloomed,
Killed the flies, and rusticated,
Killing the hours dozing there?’
Kind and sober, now, instead,
Kind and tender than before.
Kissed, and fussed about, and crowded
Kissing her dear feet as they please!
Kitchen-gardens, balconies,
Know all love’s treacherous devices!
Knowing all our joy is mortal,
Know its worth, and how it ends.
Know lives in a dreamy haze;
Know you as I, share your belief:
Lacking rosy cheeks, the manner,
Lacks charm. The new generation,
Lack the strength just now to live it,
Laid out in alphabetic order:
Lamenting what is done and gone;
La morale est dans la nature des choses.
Lamp-posts, mansions, monasteries,
18.Land of bewitchment! In past times
Lanterns glitter far and wide,
Lap dogs yapping, airs and graces,
Last night what a fright you gave me!
Last year was it? I dandled you!
6.Latin’s not in fashion now,
Laugh at whatever tickles them,
Leaning, musing pensively,
26.Leaning on the dam-wall, Lensky,
Learnt to endure their colder clime;
Leaving a shining trail, she’d shiver,
Leaving his tea and rum aground,
Leaving not a trace behind.
Lecturing me, so fiercely…yet,
Left her uncertain what to do…
Left his father, stunned by theory,
Left the cradle, play flirt, coquette,
Lends it charm, intense delight.
Lensky, blazing with resentment,
Lensky can’t believe his eyes. 
Lensky, coolly, with precision,
Lensky, for a funeral
50.Lensky is overjoyed, elated,
Lensky, keen to avoid mistake,
Lensky’s estate, worth a mention,
Lensky’s here, and with Onegin,
Lensky’s luckless sacrifice…
Lensky, Tanya’s; Kharlikova,
12. Lensky, wealthy and good-looking,
(Lepage’s make, of course) and tie
Lest from the chosen path I stray.
Lest the world, her spouse, should guess
Lest tired of pleasure, freedom won,
Let her pursue her own sweet way,
Lethe will drown all memory
Let him but breathe the passing fiction,
Let it not wither, harsh and dry,
Let me describe her elder sister.
Let me sprinkle you, fetch holy water,
3. ‘Let’s go.’ They leave without delay,
Lets him draw her to dry land,
Let’s surround him, in a trice,
Letters running to six pages,
Let us all follow his example!
Let us part now amicably,
Levels the borders of the stream,
Lies on the billiard table’s top,
Life was a riddle, and its goal
Life without albums, waists, Pauline,
Lifted from the water, shaken,
Lift her trailing hem, in flight;
Lifting the gauzy veil may glance
Light as air, ran to greet him,
Light as a swallow, and as fair
Light flashes; Eugene lifts his arm,
Lightly at the lines, by chance,
Lightly, he falls. His gaze betrays
Lightly sketched, with wash and ink,
Lights the mind with its bright ray,
Like a Bacchante, danced along 
Like a doe seen in a clearing,
Like a drunken traveller at an inn;
Like a hermit in his heaven,
Like a reed-pipe, pure, her sigh:
Like a shadow, or a wife. 
Like autumn leaves, that fall and stray,
Like bees that leave the hive, and pour
Like Byron, pride’s perfect poet,
Like Byron, who of Gulnare sings,
Like Childe Harold, mournful, dour,
Liked his dreamy tendency, 
Like fence-posts swiftly flashing by.
Like fresh air they loved their kvass,
Like him her dress was elegant.
31.Like him she wore the latest fashion,
Like Horace, peaceful and sagacious,
Like lost fading echoes flee, 
(Like love’s young dream, another jest)
Like modern verse, our empty rhyme,
(Likenesses too, of this and that)
Like pale Lenore, in moonlit ride,
Like prisoners released in sleep,
Like rose-red lips without a smile,
Like smoke dispersing in the blue;
Like stone and water, ice and flame,
Like that by Delvig’s muse created,
Like the fool I am, I clean forgot!
Like the majestic moon serene
Like the poet’s life as simple,
Like the sins that youth rehearses,
Like Venus if she’d condescend
Like women, books proved a deception,
Like yours my darling, made to hold,
Limburger cheese, soft and pungent,
Lines more worthy of such themes,
Lines too short, long, or a riddle,
Lions on gates, with frozen roars,
Listen for the heart’s first cry,
Listening with tolerance,
Listen now to my sad voice.
Listens to the young bloods still. 
Listen to our secret song,
Lived you to the full, in riot,
Live in glory…ah, but sorrow
Live in that name, what echoes start,
Long ago….It was no phantom!
Long ago, Princess Alina,
Long hours of idle reverie!
Longing to journey, day by day,
Long walks, and fresh inspiration,
Looked for a divorce tomorrow,
Looks about her…fate has brought
Looks out, noting it is day,
‘Look to the left, now, there’s a thing.’ –
Lord Byron’s portrait, by a small
Lord Byron with a shrewd despair,
Lost in her deep melancholy,
Lost in her own deep reverie,
Lost in our rural solitude?
Lost in the depths of reverie,
Lost now that power of being young.
28.Lo, the company commander,
Louder and louder grows the quarrel,
Loud farewells, with many a tear;
Loved Russia in the winter season;
Loved that cold perfection too,
59.Love faded then the Muse appeared,
Love in imagination,
Love is a mere game of Satan’s.   
Love might have found a way to save
Love my hero, as before,
Love, or hate, it shouts the truth,
Love’s enchantments: and my verse
Love’s madness, wild and unruly,
Love’s sweet crown so long awaited,
Love’s violent pains, heart’s beating,
Love yourself, your only care,
Lowered eyes grown clouded, darker,
Lowered eyes their gleams eclipse,
Là sotto giorni nubilosi e brevi
Made by sorcerers and witches. 
Madman, could your heart forget?
Magnetism or hypnosis,
Magpies in the courtyard screaming;
Maid of riper years, accepts
Make a blunt or sharp retort,
Make an escape, shield his breast
Make conversation, and to teach
Make friends, from sheer idleness.
Make him a favourite at Court?
Make poetry their occupation;
Makes a fresh road with his sleigh;
Makes his way, with corpselike face,
Make way, retrieve a handkerchief.
Malfilâtre
Malicious cowards, slanderous players,
Many a night, and many a day?
Manzoni, Herder, and Chamfort,
Marriageable girls there, in a crescent,
Marry their daughter, was the plan,
Martin Zedeka can’t allay,
Mastered I’ve no time to tell,
May be construed by your mind
May Heaven’s lightning wither you!
28.May I never meet, at a ball,
May speak, like a fond friend, of me.
May the Good Lord preserve us still!’ –
May this, my epic, if you please,
May yet accustom us to grammar,
Mazurka, gallop, waltz…they dance.
Meadows silver, sunlight meagre…
6.Meanwhile another landowner
Meanwhile in his morning dress
6.Meanwhile Onegin’s first session
Meanwhile, the sad moon dreams,
Meanwhile the village Cyclops toils,
(Mechanically, as they say)
Meet my hero of romance,
Meets her calm untroubled air.
Meet the sky in sombre lines,
Melancholy, wild, retiring,
Melds fascination with alarm) 
Melmoth, Maturin’s traveller,
Mention Juvenal by the way,
Me, or understand my moan,
Midst glittering victories, in truth,
Midst oft repeated amusement?
Midst swarms of children, lie in bed,
Might have achieved its high mission,
Might have been turned to better ends –
Might have climbed Parnassus yet
Might have met the usual fate,
Military dandies, diplomats,
Mine another destiny….
 20.‘Mine’, Yevgeny’s voice rings out,
Misty climes, and vague tomorrows,
Mocked what true hearts engender;
Modest, tender, sweet illusion,
Moments of grave sublimity,
Monotonous and varied, say,
Monsieur L’Abbé, French and thin,
Monsieur was packed off in brisk fashion,
Morality is in the nature of things.
Morals makes us nod, not sins;
More deeply in his lunacy,
More often now the sun is shrouded;
More pleasant still, if he should cry,
More sure than that of friends or kin,
More tender even, but as true:
More than once in white night-cap
More than usual?’ ‘No, the same. 
Morning comes: the dark is done,
Moscow, I dreamed of you again!
Moscow, Russia’s darling daughter,
Moscow’s a better market-place!
Moscow….what depths of fascination
Mother scolds him from the window.
Motionless and nerveless hand,
32.Motionless, like one dreaming,
Motivation, action, speech,
Mounts a goose’s neck, a skull! 
Mourning her husband’s absent kiss,
Moved our hero, I’ll allow,
Move in their harmonious sphere…
Muddling the wits of all those present.
Music’s magic, thought, and pain.
Must be worn out with travelling;
Must go, a slave to army law.
Must take this letter, secretly, to O…
Must write true odes, odes gentlemen,
My being in family existence 
My country: exile was my lot,
My darkened mind grew clear again,
‘My darling, well, I’m getting old;
My days are numbered, yet it’s true,
‘My dear Onegin, you’re yawning.’
My dear one you’re doomed to perish,
My disenchanted opera-glass, 
My eyes in vain seek out the thing
My flighty mistress and my pride,
My foolish pupil now knew
My friends, in bending: ‘It is I!’
13. My friends, where’s the sense in it?
19.My goddesses! Where? Where are you?
‘My Grandison? …Oh, Grandison! Yes!
My heart is with the good old days.
My hearts ablaze, I cried: ‘It’s he’,
My heart sinks now, in shame and terror…
My husband’s folk…do you hear?’
My husband’s wound, his valour,
My incorrigible, never weary,
My liberty, though tedious, too,
My life was but a pledge till now
My life with the domestic round;
My lips from hers will softly prove
My little book. In you, I feel,
– ‘My little one, you need to sleep.
My lively Muse and I enjoyed
My love for you is as a brother’s,
My mind….But you’re pale as a sheet:
My mind in torment, I’m alone:
My Moscow chose not to bow; 
My Muse with a grand soirée;
My newborn work, my sweet creation,
My pen I find no longer wanders,
My poor Lensky, from the heart,
(My Reader thinks the rhyme is roses:
My rhyming novel’s well in hand,
27.‘My second?’ – echoes Yevgeny:
My services to you I vow!
My songs inspired by that crowd.
My soul heard your voice ring clear,
My soul, nothing can renew….
My soul preserved its memory
My springtime’s over, in the sere?
My style is rendered quite absurd
My sweet child, as God is holy.’
My Tanya’s, appeared to me,
My Tatyana, with all my heart.
My thanks for every sweet refrain,
My thanks. I took my joy, and more…
My two youthful hermits there;
1‘My uncle, what a worthy man,
40.My verse may touch someone’s heart,
My world with equanimity, 
My youth fled by, enchantment clings.
Names like Akulka, not Céline.
Napoleon, arms crossed, with that 
Nasce una gente a cui l’morir none dole.
Nature passages of a power
Nature’s debt already paid.
Nature’s vulgar, over-active.
Nature waited, icy-fingered
Nature wakes from dream, lightly, 
41.Nearby (when the furrows ooze
Near young Tatyana, whom we 
Necker
Neighbours shook their heads, forever
Neighbour wheezes now at neighbour.
Neither pedantic nor intense,
Never doubting, lived in bliss.
Never having felt love’s blade,
Never once called on them again: 
Never placed him in the right,
Never pursue a phantom,
Never read Russian papers, sadly, 
Never scorned the world’s advances,
Never spy on what we do,
‘Never you mind that, just look…
Newly arrived on his estate,
News from town, the latest craze,
Next they sit, and talk politely,
Night falls, and the moon patrols
No absurdity, no foulness,
No affected coquetry….
No breath at all of haughtiness,
No connoisseur with opera glass,
Nodding, he laid it down instead
Nodier’s Jean Sbogar too.
No fear and menace in my tale,
No fields prove to be her neighbours,
No flavour of the social game,
37. No, for his early feelings faded,
No gift, no feast she gave him now,
No gossip could dispel his gloom,
Noise, incomprehension, blame!
53.Noise, laughter, curtsey, bow, 
No lady’s ever deigned to show
No longer even stirred his will, 
No longer forgets itself, at will.
No lorgnettes were trained upon
Nomadic tribes in humble tents;
31.No madrigals from Lensky flow
No mark of tears? …No trace, no sign!
No matter: a just fate awaits me.
No matter, hope in childish guise
No more, dear feet, of wandering
No more deserving lover,
No more of error and distraction,
Nonchalantly, full of grace,
No need to keep reserves of gold.
No, never in the fiercest fires
– No, nobody, assuredly!
No one finding any harm
No one had divined her passion, 
No one is there, beyond its seething,
No one listens, they just speak,
No one, my friends, I tell you, truly!
No, passion took no greater toll,
No pretension in her advance,
No pride, and no chilly glance,
Nor Baratynsky, who has made
Nor calls them to their pen at noon.
Nor did her troubled lips compress.
25.No reason why a man of energy
Nor ever so consumed my soul!
Nor foreign beauties, foreign views,
No rhetoric, no flattery,
Nor hours given to the Muse,
Nor long years of separation,
Nor study, nor loud celebration,
No Russian terms exist, confess,
Nor went mad, or died, as feared.
No sentiment to temper reason,
No sign of the fevered tyrant, Fashion,
No solace in the silent glade:
No suspicions… nurse, obey.’ –
Not a beauty like her sister,
Not allow that coarse seducer,
Not all will see what your soul weaves,
Not as a man of honour, sense.
– ‘Not at all.’ – ‘Well, I declare,
Not a tremor can be seen:
Not? Besides I’d have you know,
Not, blown in every direction,
Not cold at all, yet not effusive,
Not daring to stop, for then
Not even a joke half-innocent, 
Not even just by accident,
Not even plain idiocy redeems,
Not exactly what we need!
Not for long were lovely ladies
Not for the first time, made display
Nothing can provide distraction,
Nothing else could end her grief,
Nothing from that darkened glass,
‘Nothing,’ he answers, and is gone.
Nothing to occupy his life. 
Nothing touched his feelings there,
No time to retrieve it, in her fright,
Noting the pallor in her face.
Not knowing what it signifies,
Not long before, tender-hearted,
Not looking backward for an instant,
Not more, with an old blunt cue;
Not needing to prolong his stay,
Not now: we like more polished games,
No, to be with you constantly;
Not one to savour it in the least,
Not pain, but death. So, at the start,
Not she? It is though…no…and yet…
Not such as to engage his mind.
Not without cause I hail them here.
No two men were less the same
Not yet attempting to aim,
No use it seems, any more:
Novel that you choose to read,
No villain’s hidden agony,
Now along the track he crashes,
Now an underline; now a dark
Now anxious to be on his way,
30.‘Now, approach!’ Calm and steady,
Now a provincial girl, she steps;
Now at last, it’s time to dine!
Now cheerful, now full of gloom;
Now disturbs a young girl’s slumber,
Now estimates we need, in fact,
6.Now, for the first time, I reward
Now free, my verse no longer feared 
Now from the shed at morning light
15-17.Now full of grief he lacks the strength
Now he rested from his labours,
Now hostility had brought
Now imagination’s dealing
26.Now, I’m in some difficulty,
Now I must take to sounder reasoning;
14.Now, in her cruel isolation,
Now, I no longer rush to stain
Now is the moment of revenge,
‘No.’ – ‘With pleasure.’ – ‘When?’ – ‘Tonight.
Now jealousy shows its delight!
Now like some deserted place,
Now night and day he will appear
Now, no more, of ifs and maybes,
Now! Now! With joy, I call aloud,
Now our Eugene’s a countryman,
8.Now Tanya stares in fascination
42.Now, the mazurka. Long ago,
4. Now, when Eugene reached the age
41.Now, while predictable and mindless
9. Now with greater concentration,
Nudge each other, slyly wink,
‘Nurse, go now.’ She swiftly ponders:
35.– ‘Nurse, how slow you are to guess!’ –
Nurse, I’m bored, tell me a story.’
 – ‘Nurse, it’s nothing, I feel fine.
– ‘Nurse, now, that’s not the question, 
Nurtured by the mob, no dire
Object of my verses chaste:
Oblige me. Tell me that you’ll go.
Oblivious of the world around her,
Obtaining wealth, and rank, and fame,
O country life! I like you all,
Of a living work, as dubious
Of all, oblivion; this too,
Of all that sentimental stew
Of all the authors she admires,
Of an old uncle, or some father’s,
Of another, older spring,
Of a swarm of sweet desires.
Of beaus and Circes speak her fate! ...
Of beauties, with the press’s clamour,
Of boredom to her spouse, was gone…
Of candlelight, the dancers fleet,
Of clock or watch I count the hours,
Of comme il faut… (Shiskov, forgive:
Of cosseting one who’s half alive;
21.Of course, a tender beauty’s love,
‘Of course not darling, only say…’
Of criticism, most profound,
Of dances, poetry, and cards,
Of deep passions, ancient, dark;
Of despair, burn flattery’s incense,
Of every guest there, in his mind. 
Of every joy and suffering.
Of fashions always out of date,
Off as if blown by Aeolus,
Offers me her own, in quarto,
Off, in haste, with Pustyakova;
Of follies fit to test the courts,
Of guests arriving brought the word,
Of her own heartfelt confession,
Of history all turned to rust,
Of honour: ready – it was his goal –
Of horn and hoof and crooked snout,
Of how it lives, the what and why
Of its arrow, or death wings by,
Of its inscription, feel pity there,
Of leaves that vanished in the fall,
Of Lensky haunted every glade;
Of levied serfs, bathed Saturday,
Of life itself and destiny,
Of lovely woman, freakish fop. 
Of Moldavia’s gloomy reaches;
Of mortgaging his land quite weary.
Of my verse by the water’s side
Of nobility of soul; yet spite
Of noble phrases, moral too,
Of our prophetic meeting: yes,
Of our proud imperial Neva.
Of our world grant me honour; 
Of over-elaborate slander try
Of park and palace, spire and dome,
Of placid dull rusticity
Of post-horses, it made sense
Of pure regret, his only notion
Of pure respect, followed behind,
Of rank and age with which the hour’s full.
Of rationality and peace,
Of raucous laughter swell; all eyes,
Of restless youth’s tumultuous passion,
Of roses in some high romance;
Of rumours, threats: prophetic, old;
Of shame or misery, one word.
Of shy provincial innocence,
Of simple speech and rural ways
Of sky-blue eyes, a heavenly blue,
Of smoke scarce visible, soft, pale,
Of someone other, never own
Of that last cutlet’s fiery fat,
Of the poet, this world forget me,
Of the sacred flames of poesy,
Of things none dare leave behind;
Of this fickle life, my friends!
Of tortured youth and its desires
Of two tall pines; where waters wind
Of what the fashionable view,
Of whom she could not get her fill,
Of whom the age is bound to say:
Of wild geese, in noisy clans, 
Of wisdom, then for coffee rings,
Of wit, froth, free of affectation, 
Of Writers: whom I cannot blame
Of your perfection too, no less
Of your sublime clear poetry.
Oh, be spared these fearful dreams,
Oh Brenta! No: yet I’ll rejoice
Oh, farewell now, the golden days!
Oh God, what must he think of me?’
20.Oh, he had loved as in our age
Oh, horror! Better safely hidden
Oh, I’ve no strength…it’s my chest…
Oh Lord! What can I get you, daughter…
– ‘Oh my child, Heavens above, 
Oh my frivolous lost youth!
34.– ‘Oh, Nurse, you won’t refuse me.’ –
‘Oh there’ll be no end of babble,
Oh, this stupid countryside!
Oh! Those friends, those friends, so dear,
O Human Race! Why such a fever
Oh you, esteemed husbands, now
Oh, you should have heard me crying,
Oil-lamps bright on window sills,
Old age is pain and wretchedness…’
Old companions’ cruelties;
Old monkeys of another age.
Old tales they were, fables laden
Old, Tanya, and my mind…God bless,
Olga and her mother ask you,
Olga he thought would be dismayed; 
Olga’s here with tea to sip,
Olga’s less alive by far,
Olga’s little friends to play,
Olga’s there, and quietly fills
Olga’s turned into, so lovely,
‘Olga’s younger, yet she’s wed,
Olga too yawns by him, sadly
22.Olga was the first to stir
O magic night, enchanted moon…
O Muse, receive your blessing now;
On any fond face on this stage,
7.On a pine-branch bending there
On a rich pie (its saltiness,
On a steep slope, in the sun’s rays,
Once calling on an aunt, the bored
Once cold-blooded lechery
Once he heard, near his abode,
Once, it’s golden bubbles seen,
Once master had no need to scold,
Once more rejects society,
Once more resigned to being idle
Once scorned by the malicious,
One a cockerel’s head; and see
On earth but you my heart adores!
One day, to illuminate and bless
One foot planted, pirouettes
51.Onegin and I planned to travel,
Onegin begins to languish,
22.Onegin counts the hours, once more; 
Onegin drinks amidst the roar,
Onegin fires…the clock on high
Onegin has outpaced us all.  
Onegin heard the poet’s confession.
Onegin, he was deemed by many
Onegin, in this desolation,
Onegin (once more I rehearse
Onegin quietly carries her
Onegin searched the cupboards, found
Onegin’s friendship, so they met.
Onegin’s heart was deeply moved;
Onegin shudders, turns, gives a cry
Onegin, shut himself indoors,
ONEGIN’S LETTER TO TATYANA
22.Onegin’s love for books, we know,
Onegin slumbers on regardless.
Onegin smiles as he extends
Onegin spoke of them with care,
Onegin’s tongue-tied to the last,
3.Onegin’s unexpected presence;
Onegin, to the theatre where
Onegin was silent, in his fashion,
Onegin without hesitating,
Onegin, without more ado,
One has a horned and doglike face;
One I adored, but now it bores me.
One loves no longer; one alone
One melancholy jester leaning
Ones whose Mamas plot his capture.
One that, beyond the grave, never
One thing alone he studied well,
One window yields a rosy glow,
One with a fashionable feel.
One with which she’s acquainted,
28.On her balcony, alone,
On her shoulder leans his head;
On her shoulders, adjust the furs,
On him, when he heard his name,
On his own madness, to immerse
On his sledge the yard-boy seats
Only a mighty conflagration.
Only a strange sad pallor clouded
Only serene simplicity.
Only the shepherd, aged now,
‘– Only the solemn choral ode!
Only what anger may define.
23.On many pages could be seen
On my heart, to feel the straying
On my long and silent journey;
On my troubled mind intrude. 
On nightmare, like those ancient feuds
On one and all a strong impression,
On our northern snows, so gloomy,
On ramrods, and they grate together,
On reading their sad tale – surprise
On summer morns, he’ll rise at seven;
On that very couch, and rest;
On the divan, a riding-crop.
On the far bank, the smoky flare,
On the far heights, where he strayed,
On the flowers, their eyes quite red,
On the girl’s pale beauty gleams,
On the granite parapet,
On the highway, snorts and quivers;
On the misted glass, a shadow,
On the next page let them write.’
On the page, on the word ideal,
On the stone, with his own eyes
On the table, bubble, hiss,
On unknown faces, ranked, complete.
On what spring flowers are you set?
On what the state relies, he told,
On whom alone shall we depend?
On you alone I must depend
Open myself to endless blame,
Open the window then sit by me.’
Opinion, keeps the whole world turning!
Opinions they express in town…
28.Opponents! They’d not long been parted
Opposite his friend must stand.
Or a decent fellow – you or me,
Or after a long tedious dinner,
Or a hare trembles, hapless thing,
38-39.Or alternatively the poet
Or, as if they’d ceased to exist,
Or a young girl’s letter, pure, intense.
Or a young girl’s shy caress.  
Or because her love lacks art,
Or Bogdanóvich’s light verses.
Or bow to him, make distant mention,
Or by Lethe blissfully
Orchestra already tiring,
Or chondria, when we Russians speak, 
Or cuckold, foolish, of that clan
Orders Guillot, since time presses,
‘Or did her sorrow vanish swiftly?
Or else (all joking aside)
Or else…..or else, may God forbid!
Or else, reviewing distantly,
Or else that Demon of my verse.
Or end a letter with vale,
Or enjoy the funeral, as you are. 
Or far sounds rise, as wheels meet
Or finding Nature re-awaken,
7.Or force them to be reconciled,
Or frighten with a glance or two
Or from greedy lips, remove her
Or gratitude from age to age. 
Or her breast, filled with languor;
Or Idol mio, till his review
Or in solitude, and quiet;
Or in some corner, an hour or so,
Or intellect prompts mockery; 
Or in the garden, in the dawn,
Or kiss the hem of her dress.
Or, less harshly, like a butterfly
Or less: what role? Perhaps Melmoth,
Or madam’ so they all concur.
Or make this painful dream depart
Or more fitting, you’ll discover.
Or must my dull gaze fail to light
Or my tempter, force of evil:
Or on a page some other’s signed,
Or on the ballroom’s gleaming floor,
Or perhaps a pleasant rest, 
Or played a part unwittingly;
Or shouts for his Moina, merely
Or simply pay him no attention;
Or slipper fuelled the flames anew.
Or some mistake grammatical,
Or some poetic reverie
Or stir her soul, no incitement.
Or that a fiery headstrong soul
Or that the stupid are malicious;
Or the granite of the shore.
Or the lime-tree alley’s shade,
Or to ease the world’s condition,
Or to examine her at length,
Or tortured vanity, dark, quiescent, 
Or to whom we send a card,
Or two, the age drawn with élan,
3.Or un-consoled by the return
O rus! 
Or waste your efforts on the air
Or we confuse deeds with chatter,
Or we mistake the things that matter;
Or whist, that’s never out of grace,
Or with a burning hand touch hers,
Or worse still, freeze and petrify,
O, the country! O, Russia!
Our ancient customs shall rehearse. 
1.Our bored Yevgeny’s place of leisure
Our brightest hopes, and the best,
Our days of youth, now past and done)
(Our dear Lomonosov), a grammar,
Our dreams, those dearer than the rest,
Our face will never cross their mind…
Our fates lay in Fortune’s hands.
Our friend behaved well, in his way,
Our friends now are in its spell.
Our grandchildren think it no crime 
Our great language, in its pride,
Our hero’s previous address.
Our minds are full of prejudice,
Our neglected bridges crumble,
Our old modest dwelling, where,
Our past forever dead, forsaken,
Our philosopher of eighteen years.
Our poor Tatyana recognises,
Our Russian language, and yet each
Our secret balm, a tear, a sigh…
Ourselves the integer in this.
Our stomachs ­­– prompt horology.
Our Tanya, no discerning eye,
Our Tanya, not without a sigh,
Our troikas fit to run for years,
Our wanderings and again
32.Our Yevgeny was not alone
Out all the content of her heart;
Out clearly what relation means.
Out of its waxen cell, the bee 
Over a game of chess they pored,
Overcome with wit and passion,
Over it he’d rack his brains,
Over my urn, and think: “He loved,
Over-starched and rather brazen,
Over the darkened stones instead,
Over the girl, and trembling prayed.
Over the simple urn below,
Over waters still and clear,
Overwhelmed, near suffocating,
Ozerov’s tragedies for years
Paid tribute with a tear. ‘Who’s next?
45.Pale afternoon is here, my heart,
Pale, alone, and in distress;
Pale, incomplete, an imitation,
Pampered in eastern luxury
Parading there with all the rest,
Parkland, overgrown, soft shadows
Part in kindness, giving quarter? ...
Part liveried ranks, to bring relief,
Passion’s death-march brings tears:
Passion’s tempests will renew,
Past six, Onegin will be waiting.’
Past the bridge, and pond, she stops,
28.Past the doorman like an arrow,
Past the flowers, down the lawn,
Past the ranked aristocrats,
Pay attention now I beg you,
Peace and quiet – such the fine
Peacefully their lives progress,
‘Peasants there in riches wallow,
Pelt him, with ripe red cherries,
Penned by Lensky, and as he offered
Penned with unerring accuracy,
Perched on a lyre a little dove,
Perfumes in finely-crafted crystal;
Perhaps by some divine decree,
37.Perhaps for glory he was created,
Perhaps, for him…And yet, why grieve?
Perhaps her nurse, if she’d been blessed,
Perhaps I turned away too swiftly,
Perhaps that lyre, to silence fated,
Perhaps the ancient flame of passion,
Perhaps the mail’s caused some delay,’
Perhaps the troubled soul remembers
Perhaps this is all vanity,
Perhaps too (oh, flattering hope!)
Perhaps you’ve seen, on Neva’s shore,
Petrarch
Petushkov, neighbourhood Adonis,
Petushkov next, the local beau;
Pharmacies, towers, and peasants,  
Picking berries in the evening,
Pickled mushrooms for the winter,
Pinched her waist with tight laces,
Pine for you, and mourn your fate!
Pink softness of its sunset glow.
29.Pistols gleam, hammers are knocked 
Places set, each finds a chair,
Placing it carefully in the sleigh,
Plain, devoid of ceremony. 
Plants cabbages, and free from strife,
Plates, dishes chime, in unison,
Pleasant to see it hit the mark,
Pleased as I always am to stress,
Pleased that they had done their duty.
Pleasure in a thousand ways,
Pluck the gold earrings from her ears;
38.Plunged endlessly in reverie,
Plus another hidden reason,
Poet of the Giaour and Don Juan,
Poised above the letter’s folds.
Politely mentioning various topics, 
9.Politely, without indecision,
Poor Guillot stands, uneasily,
8-10.Poor Lenksy! Not for long did Olga
11.Poor Lensky! In the grave’s far bourn,
Poor Lensky’s reeling from the blow.
Poor Tanya, in her new disguise?
Poor Tanya’s youth fading fast:
Poor Tatyana was on fire,
Popping corks, and idle feasting,
Possessed of the poet’s finer rage,
Possess that cunning, share those vices,
Pots and basins, jugs; the kind
Pour out complaints, confessions, pleas,
Powder-white Lukerya Lvovna;
Powdery furrows as they race,
Praised his sheer daring; he could hit
Prematurely blighted, doomed!
Prepared for sacrificial fire:
Prepared, for the sake of gold,
Prepares herself for protocol,
Present his song-sheet, wish her wealth.
Present the clearest evidence
Presses her hand ­– his whole intent
31.Pressing his hand to his heart,
Press on! Andryushka, quicker, quicker!
Pretty yes, with that round face,
Preventing them from doing wrong!)
Prevents her from even moving.
Pride’s cold politeness, the procession
41.‘Princess, mon ange’ – ‘Pachette!’ – ‘Alina!’
				Prince Vyazemsky
Prince Vyazemsky, Muse-inspired,
Prince Vyazemsky sat beside her,
Printed among the ancient airs,
Produced his hive of comedy,
Promising, each year, again,
Prompt a dream, or article;
Prompting something steeped in gall,
Prompting your malicious laughter?
Prone to lead a fool about,
Pronouncing: ‘He was a poet!’
Propped on her elbow, now she pens,
Prose and poetry, in intent.
Proud beauties’ in their flimsy dresses,
Proud, in its glorious memories,
38.Proud witness of that fallen glory,
Puffing the pillows, you contrive
Pure devotion his desire,
Pursued him endlessly through life,
Pursue love wholly, and thereby
Pushes its grandsires to the tomb.
Pushes the door till it’s ajar…
Pustyakov the plump arrives,
Quarrelling over our estate.
‘Qu’écrirez-vous sur ces tablettes?’
Queen of mysteries and sighs. 
Quietly flows. The beetle drones.
Quite dumb, because so tightly-laced;
Quite rarefied, review my Tanya,
Racing the meadowlands alone
Raises his pistol slowly, glances;
Raise your lorgnettes, watch them closely,
Rank demands, achieves its goal!
Raspberries, sweet redcurrants:
Reaches the table, speedily,
Reaching the age of twenty-six,
Read Bayle, as well, the arch-sceptic;
Reader, alas, that tender lover, 
Reader, I’ll enhance the vista,
Reader of dreams to the age. 
49.Reader, whoever you may be,
Reader, you’d know what they say?
40.Reader, you’ve guessed, as I suspected,
Read Fontenelle. He was eclectic,
Reading a letter, silently,
Read it secretively, sadly,
Read, thus, sundry Russians still,
Ready to faint, alas, poor thing,
Ready to praise us or to hound,
Ready to save his honour, share
Ready to serve, today, tomorrow,
Recalling all the good he did,
Recalling many a lost love there
Recalling romance of time past,
33.Recall the sea before a storm,
Receive my thanks, and grateful dues,
Recited, as in reverie,
Red as a poppy, your bright face.’
Reflecting you, your noble dreams,
Refused – found consolation swiftly,
Refused to give rein to affection;
Relations then are those, it seems,
Relinquished his inheritance,
Remember what Dimitriev said
Reminded me of my attraction
Repay him: and with joyful stare,
Repeating to it solemnly
Resolute, impatient, waited,
13.Resolved to hate the false, the fickle,
Restlessness, an urge for change
Restless till the morning light.
Rest, poet, from your pilgrimage.’
Rests, on the fantasy within,
Retired, to write undying verse,
37.Returning to his home, young Lensky
Return; that innocent, her dream,
Re-upholstered, there they stand,
Revealed that calm, indifferent brow?
Reveal my soul, and thereafter
Revive. Two words, a whispering,
Reviving it the following day:
Rewarding the merely meretricious;
Rewards with its fond caress
Rhymes her, in an elegy.
30.Richardson she loved quite madly,
Rides off. A pair of pistols though,
Ringed by loyal devotees,
Rise and ripen, briefly nourished,
Rise from the shore, and soar away.
Rise, now, this merits explanation.
Rises from his hidden lair,
28.Rising with the morning light,
Roam beneath my African sky,
Roguish, coy, or see appear,
Rooted to the ground, in shame.
Round the carriage, she was there,
Rouse the dull mind from sleep,
Rousseau (I mention it by the way)
Runs to his friend, gazes at him,
Rushes to lift her, swiftly sheathing
Rushes to live, and makes haste to feel.
Russian pancakes, and they’d fast
Russian without such faults is vile,
Russia will be one great highway,
Réveillez-vous, belle endormie.
Sacred to scions of Apollo,
Sad as Zhukovsky’s Svetlana,
Sad-eyed there, sits on a bench,
Sad rustling fills the woodland ways,
Sailing the untroubled skies,
Sang of all the far-off lands
Sang Russia’s glorious ages past,  
Sang the maid on mountain high,
Sang youthful joy, and childhood dear,
Satire’s most audacious master,
Saved from Lethe’s darkened spate.
Save us, how well you’re looking!
Saw nothing good, predicted bad,
Saw nothing through the tears that glistened,
Say farewell without delay.
Saying: ‘You wrote to me, I broke
Says yes and no, but never sir
Scattered reams with flying quill,
30.Scattering herself abroad, she flies,
Scene after dull, exhausting scene,
Schiller, to scan by candlelight.
Scissors with straight blades and curved.
Scorn Moscow? Is the world so marvellous?
Scream rings out…the cabin shakes…
Screened by the hills when storms intruded,
Seated by the window pane
Second stroll, and then et cetera… 
Second: the poet might be a fool,
Secret rendezvous in sleighs;
Secure a secret assignation,
Sed alia tempora! With the rest,
Seduced like our ancestor Eve, 
See a Russian Terpsichore wing
See here too, my old master’s nook;
Seeing its sad face tremble, pass…
Seeing nothing there to gladden,
Seeking its meaning from the wise.
Seeking miracles, for his pains. 
Seeking their charms she goes to meet
Seeking the pleasure of my friends
Seeks Olga’s lovely hand in his;
Seemed as one to poor Tatyana…
Seems half a heron, half a cat!
Seem to pine, be sad or gloomy,
See, my early bird, my darling,
Sees he is loved, feels the force
Sees it all; the fashions, faces, 
Seizes a book, with rapt attention
Self, and end my poetry.
Semyon Petrovitch, still the miser;
Sends us through the Baltic trade,
Sentimental, free from care,
Settee and table, chests of drawers,
Settled, to married life converted,
Shadowy woods and crystal brook,
Shakhovskoy, so sardonically,
Shall I depict with faithful pen
‘Shall I live to see that day?’
Shall not attack the lily flower,
Shall not fade before its term.’
‘Shall we begin?’ ‘Begin, why not?
Shapes where her own imagination,
Shared wild applause, with Semyonova,
Sharing her pillow every night.
Sharing pleasures, meals, and thought.
She – always she, behind the glass...!
33.She barely notices the dawn,
She brought her glories, never ceased
45.She can’t. And why? Because she’s given
She dare not, in her shame and fear,
13.She dare not stop, or look behind,
She’d divert me, or her laughter,
She’d dream of him at dead of night,
31.She disregards him utterly,
She’d lead me in the dead of night,
She’d never argue: Let’s delay
42.She does not try to raise the man,
She’d sit all day in solitude.
She’d visit every spot with me,
15.She falls to the snow, the bear alert
She feels are things she should share,
She finds all unfamiliar, still,
She finds a spy-hole in the door,
She gazes: a discarded cue
She gazes earnestly: ‘What’s wrong?’
She gazes – feels a throbbing start,
She gazes round; the room grows light;
51.She graces the Assembly Rooms:
She halts, as if scorched by flame,
She heard our Lensky answering;
16.She hesitates, is filled with doubt:
She knows she must not see him, ever
48.She left, yet still Eugene stood there,
She lies for hours, while sleep escapes
She lights the North: ‘Now, tell me true,
7.She likes the orderly progression,
She’ll brood, or roam the woods alone.’
She loved to greet the break of day,
She loves in all seriousness,
She makes him her interpreter,
She, more pallid, and more silent! 
She never chose to rehearse.
She never took to caressing
21.She parts then, from the housekeeper,
She pays no attention to their guests
She plunges on, he grunts and follows,
She quickens her despairing pace,
She quietly took her husband’s measure,
She reads the sweet romances,
16.She recovers, gazes round,
She runs, he follows, on and on,
She rushes to him, on tiptoe,
She rushes to the open fields,
She samples them, and as if called
She scarcely breathed; made no reply;
She seems the image, to excess,
She seems to neither see nor care,
She sees him clear; and other days
She’s followed closely by the bear!
She shivers as if she were ill,
She shudders, silent, yet her eyes
She sighs and in herself possesses
She’s lost in thought now, once again;
26.‘She’s not in love then?’ ‘Tell me who!
She sorrows at the dark divide;
She’s paler than the moon at dawn,
She stands, blushing with emotion,
She’s the subject they’re debating:
She stumbles on – and yet, beware,
She trembles, burning, in fear:
She turns them all down, instead
She wanders, purposeless, a shade,
She wanders through a snowy vale
She was a girl, she was amorous.
She was no beauty, that is true,
She was sighing for another,
She weeps. The books surround her,
She wept, endured a coughing bout. 
Shine, conquer, and retreat, still single.
Shines above, its tranquil light
Shines with mist. Here a stream
Shorter and shorter grow the days,
Should be forgot…so, opportunely,
Should disregard the subject of his nails;
‘Should I turn back now, or go on? ...
Shovelling silver with a spade,
Show neither anger nor surprise,
Show respect to, love, and relish
Shutters part, chimneys smoke,
Side by side, in the gloom,
Sighing: ‘It’s high time she was wed!’…
Sight of her sweet rural display.
Signal each passing sail, each shroud.
Silent, chattering, as you please,
Silent, he bows his head before her,
Silent, leaning on an elbow,
Silently, I’m doomed to perish.
Silently impart love’s teaching!
Silently: the dawn was bright,
Silently to yawn and sigh
Silvering loosened hair, tears bright,
Simply to pass the time away
Since even he at times would sigh
(Since, fond of contradiction, Nature,
Since, foretelling to my gaze
Since, I’m one too and just the same. 
Since it’s late, and travel quickly:
Since she was mad for Richardson.
Since that old duellist is vicious,
Since time began; so, he’d resume
Since, to preserve my reputation,
Since with a cab hired from the stand,
Sing a song, unbind your hair,
30.Singer of Feasts and melancholy,
Singing, from your burning heart
Sings all night, wild roses cover
Sings of the Volga fishermen;
39.Sinks to rest…
Sip coffee; or at his request
Sipping the hour as it slips by;
Sits a crayfish; wonderful,
Sits there as he’s accustomed to,
Sits with head downcast, still holds
Sketching women’s legs and feet,
Skipping over certain pages,
Sledge rides; and the far-off haze;
Sleep and waking have their hour,
Sleep deserted her entire.
Sleepless, at the window, stares 
Sleep soundly, in oblivion,
Sleeps peacefully in blissful joy
Sleeps soundly, passes thus his days,
Sleighs and shacks and boulevards,
Slides to rest, her fall complete;
Sliding on ice, with his worn shoe,
Slippers, dressing-gown: this instant;
Slithers, and slips, in a trice,
Slowly, by his slumbering fire, 
Slumber steals, the years roll back; 
Smoky bottles, tarred with twine,
Sniffing, coughing, hissing, clapping.
Snore for snore, fat Pustyakov,
Snout, snow, storm, warlock, and the rest.
Snug as a marmot might desire;
So a poor butterfly will seek
Soaring up the marble stair now,
Soars, glistening half-ethereal,
So a seed begins to start
So be it! My fate now lies
So be it! Neutral nothingness
So blameless in their intellect,
So charming and so perilous?
Society, in short? What I’d advise
So clever, and so circumspect,
39.So, enjoy the fleeting hour
17.So Eugene preached, as she listened;
54.So far away her visions wander;
So far away in time and space,
So, for an evening game of whist,
So frowned on in society.
Softly humming: Benedetta
So hear me without tears or anger,
So he’ll double the intensity
19.‘So I joined another family,
So inflexible, so virtuous,
Solitude, silence, dark of night,
So lively are our charioteers,
So: Madame Larina, while we ride,
Some are no more, as Saadi said.
Some army type too will have written,
Some claimed the marriage was agreed,
Some decent neighbouring family
Some fool may yet achieve a trope,
Some fragment of my precious art,
Some girl, delighted that he’s found her,
Some girlish secret that they hide.
Some he liked and placed apart,
Some long fairytale’s wild nonsense
Some new work of the mask-maker,
Some profoundly moral tale,
Some stanza, preserved by fate,
Some subtle whispered compliment,
Some tell-tale, or vile inventor
Something of what these stanzas tell. 
26.Sometimes he read to Olga, 
Sometimes in my fondest dreams
Sometimes proud, sometimes humble,
Sometimes they receive as guests,
Some wild past your heart rehearses,
So morning brought no great surprise
So near! ...But now my destiny
13-15.So, often, while he’s still abed,
Soon, beneath the bridal crown,
So on Shrove Tuesday always ate
Soon, soon my mind will not remember:
Soon the dawn will bring new light,
So our age improves us creatures!
So our heedless race today
So people (I openly confess)
So, Reader, in that sorry state,
So scarcely breathing, she descends
25. So, she is called Tatyana.
So the gullible would blindly,
So thin, and sparse, and so empty,
So unapproachable, serene,
Sounds more sweetly in the silence,
So unlooked-for, I’ll not give it,
Southward stretch the caravans
25.So, Vladimir more captivated
So Yazykov, when you’re inspired
So youth’s happiness must pass,
Spared the lad from weary lessons,
Sparked a deeper train of thought,
Sparkles of icy wit appear.
Sparkling, lively, and capricious,
Speak of him, and endlessly
Speak of this and that a while;
Speak the reproach I have earned!
Sped back towards the ball, anew. 
Spend the time indoors, reading?
Spins, beats one foot on the other.
Spirals upwards, overhead;
Spoilt by each casual encounter,
Spring, ah Spring! The time of love!
Spring calls you to the fertile soil,
Spring clothes the branches with new leaves,
Squandered youth, life’s finest flower.
Squeeze her hand, kiss their friend,
Squints, half-closes his left eye,
Stables, kitchens, and a fence.
Stale gossip, news, of that they’re full,
Stalls flash by, and urchins jump, 
Standing there, his eyes ablaze,
Stares, grows mad with jealousy;
Stars the frozen shores below. 
Startling the wild ducks till they
Stated it quite positively,
St Chariton’s, the carriage brakes;
Steel bits and traces flecked with foam,
Steel combs, files in various guises,
Steps delicately on her way;
Stiffening, as his friends stand round,
Stifling a yawn with laughter:
Still add emotion to the matter,
Still bears a hope, a dream darkly.
35.Still clutching his pistol, tightly,
Still eats and drinks enough for two. 
Still forever, fare thee well.
Still hold half the world in thrall,
Still no reply, then he finds her,
Still quivering there on her tongue.
Still the throbbing is fierce,
Still wept as they unwound my hair,
Stir, as the murmuring swells; for lo,
Stirred a flicker of compassion.
Stirred by a solitary emotion;
Stirred by a stranger’s glance, it seems,
Stirs blood inside my weary heart,
Stirs the breeze, brings on the morn,
Stir the same old sweet sensation.
Stoves shone with ceramic tiles. 
St Petersburg’s high society,
Strange broken music of the steppes…
Strange his languor, there, at rest;
Strange presentiments: even the cat
Strength to complain, I confess,
Stretched across to form a bridge,
Stretched the pastures far and wide,
Strikes for the poet, at the sound,
Stripping forests, fierce and harsh.
Struck by an icy chill, Onegin
Subject now to passion’s laws;
Substituting – belle Tatiana!
Subtle, acute, and, in a word,
Such albums of provincial girls,
Such am I. Was it this you sought,
Such as they are, view these extremes
Such I adore, my dear Elvina,
(Such is the sex, all Eve’s daughters);
2.Such our young dog’s meditation,
Such stuff as Lafontaine’s suppose…
Such things belong to youth, now dead.
Such was Olga…you can paste 
9.Such were my Yevgeny’s thoughts.
Suits the likes of you and me?’
Summons the servant for assistance;
Summon sufficient self-control
17.‘Surely it’s not’ – Yevgeny muses –
18.Surely, my Reader, you’d agree
Surely, then, you can forgive,
Surrendered himself completely.
Surrender’s language, rare excess?
37.Surrounded by its ancient trees
Surveyed it, and pontificated.
Survey provincial mystery;
Sweet as the kiss of love, that’s born
Sweet conversation that inspires,
Sweeter, in night’s embrace, by far.
Swiftly apprising Yevgeny
Swiftly, she flew to meet him,
Swims across the drowsy stream,
Take domesticity to mean,
Take it then, since you’re so eager!)
Takes aim now – when, suddenly,
Takes a leap and, like down, sets
Takes to the garden, walking
10.Taking her nurse’s fond advice,
Tales from their past. The guests
Talk of Bentham and of Say,
Talk seasoned with the salt of malice;
Talks of Olga: such is love!
5. Tanya believed in every tale,
Tanya downcast, as if she heard,
Tanya had news of the decision.
Tanya, it’s gone, my memory,
Tanya lies there, cold as death.
Tanya, like a lovesick boy;
Tanya on her luck, but swiftly
Tanya recovers from her fear,
Tanya replied to each with grace;
Tanya’s birthday, filled with greetings,
Tanya should be married too.
Tanya sleeps, at peace below. 
Tanya’s the centre of all this.
Tanya was blushing, trembling.
21.Tanya watches the moon’s sphere, 
18.‘Tanya! What a notion! In those days,
Tanya with gratitude, and yet
‘Tanya!’ – ‘You know her?’ – ‘Long ago,
Tasting the crowd’s idle pleasure,
Tatyana asks: And instantly
Tatyana feels half-dead; Triquet,
Tatyana flies, as swift as faith,
Tatyana had no doll to nurse,
40. Tatyana hears their distant choir,
Tatyana hovers at the window,
Tatyana, in the darkness lying, 
25.Tatyana is no cool coquette, 
Tatyana lingers: she’s spell-bound.
7.Tatyana listened, with vexation,
32.Tatyana moans then gives a sigh,
15.Tatyana, my dear Tatyana!
4.Tatyana (Russian through and through,
24.Tatyana’s bloom is all but gone,
Tatyana screams! ...She hears a roar,
Tatyana’s husband looms near,
TATYANA’S LETTER TO ONEGIN
Tatyana such things rejected;
Tatyana takes herself to bed,
Tatyana the pale garden gains,
Tatyana was betrothed: some knew!
Tatyana! Whose name is revealed?
19.Tatyana with deep emotion,
Tatyana, with tear-stained eyes.
Taught him everything by whim,
Taunting the watch at midnight’s door;
31.Tayana’s letter’s here before me,
Tea, and jam, and endless prattle,
Tears of reconciliation,
37-9Tea, then: the girls take up, demurely,
Telling the story of his ardour,
‘Tell me will your friend appear?’
47.Tell of their conquests, others’ too,
Tells him, now is dinner-time. 
Tell the story of your fate.
Tend his roses, and rehearse,
Ten times, and never miss a beat;
– Thank God – bit by bit, to learn 
Thank God no desire claimed him,
Than that for poet, day or night.
Than the insults of this hour,
Than they, in that celestial blue.
That a friend would not repeat,
That all last winter gave you joy;
34.That; and perhaps a hidden fear,
That bitter anger, that cold brow;
That breathes a young girl’s innocence.
That can’t be a problem, surely
That distance, quencher of belief,
23.That dressing room, all solitary,
That even now can stir us so,
That fashion or luxury supplies,
That fatal sweetness, though in vain.
That folly, that past tenderness.
That heartless icy look of yours,
That helped you earn, divine Homer,
That here was wit and charm indeed.
That Hussar, Pykhtin, she confused,
(That I’d once happily rehearse) 
That I have here daubed my portrait,
That, I’m denied; and, simply
That inspired soul knew, a space
That instant, and not recognise,
That I should wed…all paths from there
That moment ­– how should we forget? –
That occupied each night and day,
That Olga occupies his mind,
That Onegin is not me, recall 
That one line in the memory
That only mediocrity
That our Yevgeny found a bore,
That plague of every modern Russian. 
That pure emotion youth may render,
That room to sit in, read, and muse. 
That sad and dangerous mystery,
That sad protest in his soul, 
That, search all Russia though,
That serious and heartless sport,
That she should hate him now forever,
That simple stall, with oaken floors
That’s it, my friend?’ – ‘No! Your pen,
That sitting by the bed all day,
That slept beneath her pillow thus.
That’s my favourite, nowadays.
That’s no ready compliment,
27.That’s not the business we’ve in hand,
That somewhere there was another,
That spleen (so Englishmen are bitten)
That’s sired by boredom out of greed.
That stands impervious to time. 
That stirs dark epigrams within me,
That’s veiled in deepest mystery.
That table nearer; I’ll be sure
That Tanya can reach the door.
That the country bores you, sadly;
That there existed chosen vessels,
That there’s no infamy so deep,
That the substance of my verse
That they by Mother Earth are blessed! 
That thirst for truth, toil’s midnight flame,
That to us is nothing new. 
That washed its face, and purred,
That was ordained by fate, alone…
That with sheer beauty charms Tatyana
1.That year, the autumn lingered,
That young girl…is it a dream...?
That young girl, it would seem
That your pencils were all blunted,
The Academic Dictionary. 
The accounts were done, and swiftly
The ageing laurels of my crown!
The ally she was born to love,
The altar-fire’s extinguished now. 
The artiste’s flatterer and traitor,
The audience, their feet still tapping,
The aunts, unsure what to think,
The babbling brook, the silent furrow,
The balcony, whose throng oppresses,
The ballet’s beat he should be at.
The band will come: they’re on their way,
The bearded outrider’s astride
The bear has gone; she’s in a hall;
The bear speaks: ‘Friends live here,
The bench beside her, where the nurse
The best dog, Dasher: he’s the horse,
The bitter record of the heart.
The bitter-sweet lure of ambition,
The blare of music, and the fumes
The breathless meeting of young lovers;
The breath on her lips is glazed,
The brief acquaintances were ended. 
The bud of life’s fairest hour,
The bullet shattering his chest.
The call of fame, praise, I forgot,
The cards, and play whist with me,
The careful spouse as much his man,
The carriage horses, chilly, wait,
The casual, the idealistic,
The cattle low; a nightingale,
The cause of which it’s time to seek,
The censors must have work to do.
35.The chairs scrape backwards on the floor,
The charms of sweet simplicity.
48.The chatter, and the conversation,
The child of luxury and delight.
The children learn their ABC.
The child with her obedient doll,
The circle claps to make all happen, 
The city gates gleam white; they’re near;
The city’s sounds swiftly wake her,
The clamour of a wake; unsure,
The classic mask, the trumpet, sword,
The Cleopatra of the Neva,
The clock runs swiftly on and on,
The clock strikes ten. He’s at the door;
The clouded moon, and on the wall
The coachmen by the fire free
The cobbles of Milyona Street.
The cock-crow hails the morning star;
The cold ash hides no smouldering ember,
The colonel’s sent them, so, a dance!
The Comet’s vintage, year eleven.
The congregation sit and yawn,
The conversation of the powerful,
The coolness of the dark glades too,
The corpse on a table laid,
The Corsair or the Wandering Jew, 
The country caused the same ennui
The creature once again is near;
The crescent moon, at her left side,
The crowd spills into the hall,
The crunch of snow…someone goes by;
The crushing boredom of bon ton.
The crush intense, the noise is loud.
The crush, the lights, the gaiety,
The crush, the stir there, and the heat.
The cue’s abandoned, half-lights fade,
The dance-floor was my passion:
The dance to Olga, as he’d planned;
The darkened river, vapours fill;
The dawning day in sombre cloud. 
The dawn is breaking, crimson, bright,
39.The days flashed by ­– and with the sun
36.The day slips past, with no reply,
The dead man buried priest and guests
The deepest secret of her heart,
The delights of frosty days,
The desk with its shaded light,
The dogs run towards her, barking,
The door flies open, Olga’s there,
The door swings open, wide it flies,
The double windows, cosy fire,
The doubts that stirred in his soul
The dove will soon forget its mate.
The dream! Where’s sweet elusive truth?
– The duellists remove their cloaks,
The dullards we deem necessary;
The eager nonsense I may pen
The easier she is to win,
The easier to snare and ruin,
The East is indolently white,
The echo of midwinter’s cold!
The Enchantress, Winter: here is she!
The eye to hides its joyfulness…! 
The faces seen in every room,
The faithful friend of wintry nights.
The fancies of a foolish mind,
The fear of error, and of shame,
The fields, the woods, that silent stand,
The fight is done, the sword is still,
47.The fire dies down; the ashes veil
The fleas at halts drive you mad,
The flower has faded from the bough,
The foolish dreamer sees them whole
The foolish horizon honours.’
The formal dinners stretch ahead,
The fortunes of the young are told;
The French cuisine’s finest proof,
The frost glitters. We give thanks,
The fruit of carefree hours, unplanned,
The fruits of learning’s golden tree,
35.The fruits of my own meditation,
The future by some magic art,
The general, flattered by the diet
The gentle sex is light as down.
The girls are stowed with Tatyana,
The girls in fashionable dress,
THE GIRLS’ SONG
The girls’ true idol, at least the older
The gist of some great state affair,
The gleaming radiance on snow,
The gleam of wit and silken dress,
The glittering frost on shiny days;
52.The glittering night holds many a star,
The glittering stars, their endless trains,
The gloomy eccentric, where is he,
The glow of the poetic flame,
The golden coals, a slender thread
The greater her attempts to fly,
The green card-tables are in place,
The groves and meadows at her feet,
The guests have come, the hour is past,
The guileless stories, not a few
The hall is crowded, shoving, pushing,
The hand no longer drives the cattle,
The heart alive with kiss and look;
The hearth glows, pipe-smoke passes,
The heart of a confirmed coquette!
The heavenly drink, you’d agree,
The heavy friendship of a spouse?
The hero’s name I’ve given too;
The hill slope and where it ends
The histories of every nation,
The history of the passing gale,
The holy secret, lost forever, 
The homage rank may engender,
The honour paid it is not great;
The horses scent the dead, and rear,
The horses to the oak nearby.  
The hours of anguished prayer I knew, 
The hour that must decide his fate.
The hour when all must say goodbye.
The housekeeper nods her through:
53.The house was filled with commotion,
The human harvest to our eyes,
The huntsman by the hedge, concealed. 
The husband was the first to pass
The ice that paves the hidden streams,
The imprint of his fingernail,
The indulgence of a childhood friend;
The inexperienced come to grief.
The intellect’s cold observation,
43.The invalid’s kind words must fill
Their absent masters to berate. 
Their arms entwined about each other,
Their branches, as she stumbles on,
Their carriage wheels, briskly rode,
Their coachmen, seated, wield the lash
46.Their daughters offer their embraces,
Their dinner-table and their wife. 
Their empty world, or so it seems.
Their errors of pronunciation,
Their family, or the hounds, no shine
Their fathers saw them marrying,
Their golden crosses, lifted higher. 
Their greetings, ah, what a beauty
Their harness chafing, restlessly,
Their hopes, their pranks, their reveries;
29.Their incorrect and careless chatter,
Their laughter noisy, tedious,
Their loads are placed in position;
Their loss, without pain or regret,
Their love, their hatred, went un-missed.
Their questions pointless, dry and dull;
Their raucous games so frivolous.
Their sentiments were re-born.
Their solid grasp of every matter,
Their steaming cups, have barely stirred,
Their tendency to sit, and sit. 
Their thirst, clink pitchers in the flow;
Their very presence causes spleen.
Their violence seems ridiculous
Their visits an unwelcome folly,
Their words, their looks, both are sweet,
The jagged flints once firmly seated,
The jealous ladies whisper sins.
The journey took them seven days.  
The joy and pain she’s cherishing,
The ladies framed by gentlemen,
The ladies seated; then away:
The ladies sit beside the fire;
The lads run to find a guide:
The lady of the manse has fled.
The language of the gods, her songs
The lengthy silence ends, refined
The less of use her efforts prove.
1-7.The less we show our love to woman,
The letter’s done, is folded, sealed…
The letter trembles in her hand;
The light-footed girls sweep by,
The like of them, one or more.
The little foot I touch it seems;
The load on each kibitka sways,
The lonely grove where a stream
31.The long-delayed departure day
The love-god, Lel, overhead
The lover too of Rousseau’s Julie Womar,
The manor house was quite secluded,
‘The man’s a lunatic, a boor,
The master often brooded there.’
The matchmaker spent two weeks trying
Them both, but no one knew her mind,
The meadows and the slopes of hills;
The men all bowed deeply to her,
The merchant and the beggar rise,
The merry lads cut with their skates,
The mile-markers soothe the eye,
The milkmaids from Ochta go
The millions of two-legged creatures
The missive gave a caustic grin:
Them often feign a change of mind,
The moon, a lamp in the sky,
The moon is hidden by a hill;
The moon no longer shines as bright,
22.‘The morning star will tremble bright,
The Moscow belles are many too,
The muddy pool, my friends, that we
The murderer of their dear friend;
The Muse gave it eternity,
The Muse he might well have deserted,
The Muse set my world alight,
The Muse was ever at my side.
Then a buzz, while all are seated.
42.Then, across the fields, slowly,
The naked woods show downy green.
Then all was altered, and again,
Then as the rural evening nears,
Then, at Zaretsky’s insistence,
Then by the stream, beneath the beech
Then calmly stir his jealousy,
Then carry the dread thing away.
22. Then come Cupid, imp and snake,
Then dashes off uphill, in flight.
Then disenchantment, bored desire,
Then down Tverskaya Street they bump,
The new-born sun, the day is dawning,
The new ones simply antiquated,
The next room too; unoccupied,
Then father blessed me, and said yes.
Then from a dish, rings are taken,
Then from the heights she sees
Then gather momentum in its slide.
Then gaze at Tanya, silently,
Then grasped the instant by the throat,
47.‘Then happiness seemed possible,
Then he bowed to her, in silence,
Then he turns away – and yawns,
Then his father passed away,
Then how did you come to wed?’ ‘Tanya,
The night’s shadows thinning swiftly,
44.‘Then, in that rural wasteland, far
Then in the crowd inside that hovel,
Then, intrigued by the collection,
Then know: I’d rather suffer all;
Then later, intimacies meeting,
Then Lensky falls, robbed of life,
Then like a very sage could seem
Then listen now, in secret, with me.
Then Monsieur taught the child
Then my ‘cousin’, Buyanov,
Then my student cell was bright
Then nature trembles, deathly pale,
The noble elegies you’ve sired,
The noble ode’s great master still;
Then off to ramble in the park.
The noise subsides, and faces glaze;
The noise, the glare, the masquerade,
The noise, the tempests, and the feast,
The noisy brawl, the banquet’s roar,
Then Olga’s suitor, Lensky’s here:
Then Onegin swiftly dresses, 
Then play a note or two before,
Then plunged into domestic labour.
Then poetry flows from his pen,
Then poke Tatyana, whispering:
Then proud ladies, see her glide,
Then prove his own mortality,
Then rattle on at lightening pace. 
Then replaced, their case shut tight;
Then rooms are found for every guest,
– ‘Then send your grandson, and he
Then settle like the evening mist…
Then sips the news from some vile font,
Then so be it: in friendship part,
Then supper, bedtime, by and by,
Then take his way, despite the chill,
Then tea arrives. Not by the chimes
Then the servant’s noise presages
Then the shining day will dawn,
Then, the year through, we can hide,
Then they’re off again in style,
Then, till Morpheus brought her rest,
38.Then too, with fervent weeping,
Then to the altar, by and by…. 
Then truly, in this life,
The nurse. ‘It’s love. Leave me alone.’
The nurse, old Filipevna, 
Then what an epic I’ll contrive,
Then you would weep, yet your tears,
The object of his constancy;
The ode shows pure nobility
The old crone comes at their call,
The old man had no time to look
The old mother, broken-hearted,
The old ones utterly out-dated,
8.The one awaited….he is here;
The one on Hades’ Gate: Surrender
The one poor Ovid used to sing,
The one she fears and idolises –
The one she wore in former days;
‘The one who sat by the window,
The only law that I employed;
The opponents wait, with downcast eyes.
The orchestra, the stalls, they seethe,
The pain of time lost, past recall:
The parlour’s full of unknown faces,
The passer-by can read the legend
The paths of humble prose I’ll follow
The pile of books, then the bed
The pineapple’s pure golden unguent. 
The place where my poor nurse was laid
(The place where we began, you see)
The pleasures of the local gentry
The poet awaits Eugene’s reply:
The poet burning with opinion
The poet is no more…the end
The poet’s bold impassioned speech,
The poet’s soul from every ill,
The polished table shines, I fear 
The power of some life-giving voice
The power to rule, in every feature,
The praise the endless tides rehearse,
The prejudices of the ages,
The presentation of the guests
The price three-fifty for the pair,
The Prince, amused, turns his head,
The Prince has sent an invitation
The Prince presents him, in the end:
The Princess gazes at Eugene,
The princess, in a simple dress,
The punctilious German baker,
The radiance dies: there the vale
The rage and spite she cannot know,
There a minister, out of office,
There an old head of scented hair,
There beside the Neva’s shore,
There Didelot too crowned his day,
There in the garden, where we met,
There is a stream, and here a hill,
There I too strolled to and fro:
There lives, and thrives no less,
There of wit, true conversation,
29.There’s a lull in conversation,
There’s Dominique de Pradt, or Scott.
There she stands, helplessly.
There’s no escape, in her sad mind,
There’s no reason for you not to.’ –
33.There’s no response. He writes another;
There’s Princess Helena’s tulle bonnet,
There stands a simple monument.
There such freedoms are allowed,
There’s very little pleasure there.
There the Muse first came near.
There the Petrovsky palace rises,
There they sit, the minutes pass,
5.There was a time when envious faces
There was no end of speculation,
There was no trace to be seen,
There were some favourites he kept;
There, where days are cloudy and brief,
The roads are smooth, the burden light.
(The Romantic style, or so they say,
The room is loud and growing louder,
The roses of her burning cheeks,
The rural dancers now retire
The rustling curtain as we breathe
The sacred letters, O and E. 
The safest place for a lover
The same husband, the same pooch,
The sarcastic and the chill
The science of the tender passion
The seal, I have read your letter.
The seal with her monogram,
The secrets of the grave, the pages
The secrets of the marriage bed,
These hours that fate has plotted,
The sensual touch, on rugs to tread
The serfs applauded his intent.
The servants gather by the gate,
The servant’s looks pure irritation.
The setting for a pretty face.’ –
These varied chapters in your hand,
The shadows thicken, till a dreadful
The shepherd, weaving his bast shoes,
The shining tea-cups, never spills
The shy, sweet girl whose adoration
 38.The sickness, with which he was smitten,
The sign of the cross she made
The simple girlish way she loved.
The simple lore of bygone days;
The Skotinins, turning grey,
The sky aglow above the Neva,
The sky with autumn’s breath is clouded, 
The sledded coaches, stored away,
The sledge is waiting, at the door,
The smart coquettes’ smart enemy,
The sober-headed, for whom each
The soft snow reaches to her knee;
The solitariness of the meadow,
The soul’s fire cooling of late.
The soul with torment and delight;
The soul, wreathed in its sadness;
The sound of hooves! ...Sent to freeze
The Spanish ambassador, there,
The speeding cabs whirl out of sight
The spring revived him. He hastened
2.The stately pile was nobly planned
The steward came; he’d read a book…
The storm is done, and cruelly,
The storm that shook my soul for years
The sumptuous mansion gleams,
The sun now dispels the darkness,
The swift kibitkas’ runners trace
The tale forgotten and the stone;
The talk turns with quiet persistence
The Tambov wit, Monsieur Triquet,
The tears flow from my eyes,
The tedious halts that, with delays,
The tender style in which she wrote,
20.The theatre fills, the boxes glisten,
The thoughts of other men to rifle;
The threatening flames skyward soar.
The thundering breakers’ mighty roar,
The tongue of Petrarch and of love.
The torments of the soul, the pain,
The tribute that to folly’s made.
The twilit view beyond the glass, 
The twin lights of the carriage throw
The two friends’ greeting scarcely hears,
The two old women weep, embrace,
The unapproachable goddess,
The useful arts, can devise,
The valleys show a dappled sheen;
The vault of heaven. Near her room,
The very girl, he’d kept her note,
The veteran is stirred, grows pale,
The vile and venomous worm
The visit, a note he proffered,
The wafer meant to seal it’s dry,
The wary traveller first shivers,
The way to turn a verse or two;
The wealth of nations was his topic;
8.The wealth of things my Yevgeny
The whispering girls elsewhere conspire;
The wild host vanishes from sight,
The windows rattle in their frames.
The winged god hovers overhead.
The winter snows soon disappeared.
The wit of former days displaying,
15.The women all gathered to her;
The woodland path is overgrown,
The world he wandered with his lyre,
2.The world received her with a smile,
The world; the ball, are left behind,
The world to him both sealed and dumb? ...
The wretched wreath of elegy (sic),
They abhor it when we’re tender.
They bring on the poor child’s guitar,
They cross themselves, grace is repeated,
They crowd into the drawing room
They, dear Moscow’s living graces,
44.They dine out at the relatives
They’d stroll about on the lawn.
They’d welcome you with great delight.’
They exchanged their childish vows,
They exit; Lenksy loth to leave.
They find her strange, somewhat affected,
35.They held to, in their peaceful state,
They keep to their habitual ways:
They lift the cold body to its bier,
They’ll grumble, swap the latest gossip,
The young girls dream, in a trance,
The young man fled their noisy chatter,
‘They’re all past they’re best’ he sighs;
32.They’re harnessed to the master’s sleighs,
They’re here before me, his in truth:
They’re never worth the singer’s fire,
They rode together every day,
They say in turn’s the nearest spa.
They say there’s no sweeter delight
30.They sit across from our Tatyana,
They the masters, to his eyes. 
They took offence, and once offended
They’ve come to an old aunt who’s ailing 
They’ve taken four steps already,
They wed her, without her consent. 
They were one instead of two.
They yet can thrill me in my dreams. 
Thinking every place you view
Thinking of Eugene, all the while,
Thinking with a mournful sigh,
Thirty two paces, precisely. 
This day to come, what will it bring?
This deep and learned opus to her,
This fever born of youth once past,
This fortune-telling, I’ll let be. 
This heartfelt speech, gave the notion,
This hostile climate where I wander,
This house, the soirées, my whole fate,  
This idol for your mind, and pen,
This letter here, don’t you see,
This nightmare whirling, on and on.
This perpetual sterile talking,
This Phyllis, who’s so interesting,
This ruthless critic, legislator,
This the message your note brought?
This tinsel of a life I hate,
This unrewarding tête à tête, 
39-40.This whole exhausting journey takes
Those dear creatures, oh, you know it,
Those dishes of preserves appear,
Those feelings, so long quiescent;
Those first successes gave us wings;
Those high aims ambition fashions,
Those keenest to take part are summoned,
(Those Memoirs), and two Petriads
Those with other meaning. He
Those years of hope and tender rage,
Though a provincial town affords
Though blank pages would be better;
Though, dear Reader, I confess
Though great, our poet is immune
Though he can’t bring me happiness.’
Though he’d no wish to betray
Though he’d occasionally misfire
Though he is unknown to you,
Though he knew the human race,
(Though he thought that country life
Though I fail to see what’s romantic
Though I’m an adept at description,
Though in exchange he took as well,
Though, in her indifference,
Though innocent tries one’s patience.
Though it adds to conversation,
Though it’s perfect for an epigram…).
Though it’s true some woman may
Though I’ve consulted frequently
Though late, have the exordium too!
Though not indeed that she was one,
Though once they sang my gifted pen:
Though over-zealous, it is true;
Though precious time goes swiftly,
Though privately they’d be reviled,
Though Racine, or Seneca
Though sad echoes still resound.
Though seeing the tenderness in you,
Though she requires a madrigal!
Though she’s unmoved by it, no tears
Though silent on the bad he hid. 
Though some of us are born to range.)
Though that cranberry juice may kill:
Though the house is empty, use 
Though the North affects me so.
Though they seemed devoid of sense. 
Thoughts and feelings, noble, tender?
Thoughts of fleas and lemonade;
Thoughts of her his inspiration.
Though we’d deny its flight, is over. 
Though we decried them, at the time.
Though why, I can hardly tell.)
Though why it is, who can say,
12.Though young he learnt the way to stir
Though you’re a spouse respected,
Thou, my Svetlana.
Threads the rows among the feet,
Threats, entreaties, vows and fears,
Three bottles a day, for him, chez Véry.
Three houses offer a soirée:
Three large kibitkas, by tradition.
Three notes appear, on a tray.
Thrilled him in its former way,
Through its pages swiftly combs,
Through meadows, down a lime-tree alley,
Through my garden, once urbane
Through our work, of lost genius:
Through the borders, gains the stream,
Through the fashionable scene,
Through the frosted glass, and then
Through the grave’s gloomy portal,
Through the hall, our hero’s there,
14.Through the wood she flees the bear;
Through this wide world. We bow,
Thus the country view of hooking
Thus, you never would have heard 
Till in the grave we shall rest…
Till January the third, at night,
Till Lensky, with abstracted look,
Till the flame is dying out;
Till travel, with its tedious motion,
Time dragged slowly or it flew,
Time’s done it’s work, I must confess,
Times from her dear Moscow cousin,
33.Time was when she would write, in blood,
Timidly, once in a while,
Tired of repeating platitudes,
Tired of the laughter of the age,
Tired of this cotillion;
To a bachelor’s sad existence,
To a frail bed in a corner, there,
To all my plaintive misery.
To all this; yet, an innocent,
To all unfaithful by and by,
To a love both shy and tender,
To an unknown world’s enthralled. 
To any but ourselves alone. 
To a soul that perished long ago;
Toasting his fair neighbour, Lensky,
To attract a passing lover.
To avoid the usual expense
To bear on things we’ve all eschewed,
To bear the marriage-yoke as yet,
To beat once more its rainbow wing,
To be condemned impartially,
To bee and butterfly unknown. 
To be forgiven; trembles; mute;
To blow his brains out, as we’re told,
To bring his medicine unsmiling,
To bring, with love and solace bright,
To burn – while reason forcefully
To call a last farewell: it’s late;
To challenge him I’ve no intention
To Champagne I’m no longer true,
To cheers, applause. Tanya now
To crowd us out before our time!
To cry aloud: ‘She’s mine, she’s mine!’
Today, it is my turn to speak.’
Today…no wreath hangs on the bough,
Today we know, truth to tell
To delight in childish play, 
To deviate from established ways
To dispute the entrance to the grave –
To don a mask, in form and speech,
To dream affection constantly
To drive bold tunnels underwater,
To each other, but liking grew,
To ease heart’s suffering, find fame:
To ease the pain his love incurred.
To enter on the masquerade.
To face society’s derision,
To feast our eyes on foreign lands,
To fight the waves, and scour the sea,
To fill up my declining days.
To find her passion, and her dream,
To flee the place; She cannot move,
To follow him, pursued the trail,
To gaze at will, in her direction,
To gaze on, of the former Tanya;
To give his life for poetry,
To greet them, and to hold her nerve.
To hear the Nereids’ whispers bright,
To hear the tale told by another,
To help her cross, she gathers strength
To her family a stranger.
To her nurse is softly sighing.
To her village, despite its hovels,
To his defence should slander lie;
To his Lovelace, Grandison, 
To his rivals, that whole set,
To his stand the cabman drives,
To his Tatyana, though rejected,
To hit the head, or break a thigh.
To imbibe it, friends: recall?  
To infuriate your enemy,
To join them, it’s next Saturday,
To journalists for their consumption
To judging other ways of living;
To keep from the gambling table.
To keep well clear of them, I vow,
Token of every beauty, good,
To kiss the young Armida’s lips,
To know its beauty, be its friend.
Told in winter, late at night.
To lead her to the other side;
To leave a name for fate to find,
To leave his place of hibernation,
To Lensky’s young, receptive heart.
To lie at her feet, in peace again!
To listen to you, and to know
To little feet, entrancing ladies.
To long to fall there, clasp your knees, 
29.To love the ages must submit;
To make an end, than take the waters;
To make a passer-by think twice:
To make of that; her own distress;
To make the soul of man rejoice,
To me – joyous things that shine,
To mend Europe’s dainty coils, 
46.‘To me Onegin all this splendour
To mesh him deeper in our net.
Tomorrow just like yesterday.
To mourn there for gloomy Russia,
To my Tatyana, all is one. 
Too dark for driving some would claim, 
To offer up the Kremlin keys.
Took his old medal for a toy!
Took to the road, went post-haste,
To Olga, his hours he devotes;
To Onegin. Dear God in heaven!
Too often by a foreign word,
To our dance, to our choir.
To our hero, who concedes
To our measure, in the end?
To our neighbour… he, you know,
To our poetic brotherhood,
To pair Yevgeny and I,
To pass a note of assignation.
To persuade my parents, no less,
To Peter Alexandrovich Pletnev
To prejudices rarely seen
To pride; he’s first to drink her health,
To products of my inspiration,
To punish me with your derision.
To raise a smile, provoke a tear,
To read an epigraph, and might
To read him, nor preferred really
To read in Russian. Ah, what horror!
To ready himself, have all in place,
To rescue it, as is his custom,
To rest, beneath the woodland shade.’
To roam the forests green, so us,
To rouse his friend to indignation,
To running things the modern way;
To say her farewells to the pair. 
(To say nothing of our verse),
To see Onegin dead, my friends.
To see, unwillingly, as they pass,
To see what fresh enlightenment,
To see you but once a week,
To separate blancmange from roast,
To shelter lovers’ trysts aspires;
To show intelligence and grace,
To show themselves, twirl, and jingle,
To sighs, or praise, or flatteries. 
To sing for the guests above the wine;
To sing of life’s dry withered flower. 
To sleep later. Now goodnight.’
To speak about the night before,
To speak the language of the heart;
To strike a billiard-ball or two,
To suffer at your feet and so
To suffer passion’s parching thirst, 
To supply the details, by and by. 
To tell iambic from trochee.
To tempt her with his base desire.
To the fields, my friends! Run, run!
To the hands of fashion’s monster,
To the hostess they raise the chalice
‘To the left? Where? What’s to see?’ –
To the magic bow in thrall,
To the object of his adoration,
To the old dears’ perennial cry:
To the spinning-wheel’s low rattle,
To the stream below the hill.
To the young hostess, one by one;
To this half-Russian gentleman.
To torment fashionable rhymesters,
Touching lightly on each theme,
Touching the earth with her light feet,
To use their nags, and so prolong
Towards me, wake hope in my heart,
Towards the valley down below;
To watch him lying on the ground,
To what their mistresses were fated,
To where the silent shallows gleam,
To which we dedicated then
To whom hope her brightness lent,
To whom in rural solitude,
‘To whom, my dear, who is this he?
To whom our hearts were consecrated,
To whom the first few lines were read…
To whom the passing forms appear
To yield poetic inspiration,
Toying happily with the Fates.
To your heartfelt, despairing cry?
Traditions of the ages past,
Translated the sublime Corneille,
Translate my Tanya, with a will,
Travel’s easy, a delight;
Treading the boards interminably,
Treads the skies.’ Well now, I might
Trees crowd round; it’s drowned in snow,
Trembled at omens, anxiously;
Trembling like a hunted fawn.
Trembling too, with her intent,
Tried to write, it makes him ill 
Tries to calm her beating heart,
Triquet; Buyanov then steps
Triquet, ingenious poet, dares,
Triquet rises, with noble gaze;
Triquet’s slumbering on the floor,
Triumphant you’ll see winter through.
True, contempt should rightly answer
Truly his star is in eclipse! 
19.Truly! She didn’t even shiver,
Truly? ...Yes, indeed, our hero!
Trusted also his friends were there
Trusted her himself, quite clearly,
Truth to tell, his knowledge slight,
Turned, and saw before her: ‘Why,
Turned to the envoy, mutely waiting,
Turning his troubled gaze on Olga
Turning meadowland to marsh,
Turning on the alien mass
Turn pale, or blush with distress, 
Turns its leaves, no word or tear; 
Turns on the stage indifferent eyes,
Turns, page in hand then sings away
Turn to her; and every guise,
Turn to my hero, lest his fate
Twice a year, loved Christmas carols,
Twists her waist one way, another,
Two bullets ­– nothing else – await
Two girls, when the moon shone clear,
Two hearts, some flowers, a torch assure,
Two hearts there are, two that grieve
Two hours at least, but then, once past,
Two, in uniform; he hardly took
Two slender boughs glued by ice,
Two slender feet…Now sad and cold
Two whole lines of the Aeneid.
Unbearable to see before us
7.Un-blighted by the world’s cold malice,
Unbridled passion was his truth.
Uncomfortable, unsmiling pearls;
Unconsciously, apparent there:
Under Goethe’s, Schiller’s skies,
Under her parent’s gaze she grew
Under the oak-trees’ sheltering boughs,
Unfashionable, but that’s expected,
Unfathomable, even to the bold,
Unhappy with the role he’d played.
Unifying every by-way.
Unnoticed, Tanya seated now,
Unripe powers, or fading art,
Unsuitable for girls to hear),
Until a fresh discovery
Until (a wealth of thanks conceive),
Until her strength is all but gone.
Until his Breguet’s sleepless chime
Until, such good friends were they
‘Up now, and no procrastinating:
Upon it, sadly, Tanya leant,
Up through the flue, sparkling glasses
Used the nasal ‘n’ in places
Ushers Tanya through the hall,
Us then, and I, I was just thirteen. 
Utter a few words of greeting,
Uttered in those days of bliss,
Valued feelings, with empty heart.
Vapour wreathes the china pot.
21.Vast applause. Onegin enters,
Veiled in mist, as in a dream, 
Verse sounds, as he strides the floor,
Verses, quarrels: ah, what dreams!
Vexation? Vanity? Or, in truth,
Vice was ruthlessly put down,
Virgil, Byron, Walter Scott,
Virginal hope within her breast,
Vision, standing by my bed,
Visit my humble corner, keep
Visits to at Christmas-tide,
Vladimir Lensky, is the man
Vladimir replies. They start
Vladimir shuts the book once more,
Vladimir thought him quite wrong,
Voice, manner, slender waist, 
Voice of lover, foe and friend,
Volume Three of Marmontel
Wailing aloud her tragic part,
Waited on Moscow’s submission,
Waiting there, her cheeks on fire, 
Wakes, and to the house she flies.
Walks on forever: on and on.
Walk? The countryside you roam
Wanders among forest choirs
Warmth, growth and outdoor toil,
Warning her of this and that,
Was a very dandy in his dress,
Was bored again beyond all measure,
Was driven, in no uncertain fashion,
Was dross enough for many lives. 
Was for a while her entertainer;
Was granted to us all in vain,
Was heard at the Larin’s no more:
Was he as vigorous and carefree 
Was he from Heaven or from Hell,
Washing, with fresh snow, removed
Was in fact a fine estate,
Was it for you all that distress? 
Was it not, with such pure pleasure,
Was just a lad, if you could have seen
Was made for this very part.
Was no surprise: so simple, true?
Was not enamoured, thought him mad
Was once my sole preoccupation.
Was praised, all that debauchery
Was revealed, recorded whole,
Was she the one who but now
Was this what you hoped to find;
Was thought something of a catch;
Was with Tatyana, not, in truth,
Watching its flight with anxious eye,
Watching the molten wax assume,
Waves her mantle, somewhat tawdry,
49.Waves of the distant Adriatic,
We all possess Napoleon’s features;
We both should take a little rest…
We’d never heard the word. One sigh
Wed, the fire would soon have died;
Welcome her with open arms,
Welcome with joy the winter’s pranks.
We’ll move the mountains, and pay
‘Well?’ says Zaretsky, with force.
We’ll show off Tanya, a pity though
We’ll take the trail towards the stream,
Wenches and coachmen swearing;
Went to pay his fond respects,
Wept for her daughter; as they parted
Wept violently in her sorrow,
Were all their constant study.
Were changing with the passing days.
Were ever dearest friends of his,
Were it within my power,
Were not her forte; horror stories
Were substitutes for happiness. 
Were what gave her most delight,
Were you in love? I must know!’
Werther, born to be a martyr,
We sing those who, fortunes made,
We still tremble, being sober,
We think the others noughts, alone
We too, we too, the same old way;
5.We’ve all acquired some education
We’ve no use for Parny’s rhymes
We’ve toppled Lovelace as we ought,
We wrote all those secret rhymes,
What ails him? Is it some strange coal
What are they? I could dispense,
What bitter scorn in your expression,
What can I hope for? With what aim
43.What can one do in such a season?
What consoles them is our fear,
‘What do I haunt the ballet for?
What do you say?’ – ‘Alright!’ – ‘Bravo!’ –  
What dreams or cards portend, grew pale
Whatever chapter most entrances,
Whatever he may say or do, 
40.Whatever the future might have brought,
Whatever trouble you are in.
What foolishness, and what complete
What future does fate hold in store?’
What has all that to do with me,
34.What if your pistol-shot inflicts
15. What in the world is worse than this,
What? Invitations? Swiftly read,
‘What is it Tanya, dear?’ ‘It’s trifling:
‘What is your name?’ He moves on,
What languor fills her breast, my sweet!
What languor’s in her magic glances!…
What laughter from enchanted streams,
What might result: ‘Ever prepared.’
What more is needed? All agreed
What mother preaches constantly.
What odes might Vladimir have written,
19.What of it? Well, my true intention 
What passes now through her mind?
What reply? A harsh rejection.
What spirit too! Before we’re older,
What’s this he’s hearing? Can it be…?
What stirs there, hidden from the eye?
What’s to be done? As we all know,
‘What’s to be done? She’s not a child.’
‘What that fat general?’ – ‘He’s gone!’ 
36.What then? Though his eyes moved on,
What thorns, not roses, through the years
What traps he set for those abused!
What we sing’s not meant for you!
Wheeling in its circles, tireless
When a fashionable lady
When all of Petersburg’s abed,
When, betrothed, she had seen her,
21.When but a boy his heart was captured,
When far ahead of his battalion,
When he shows, with the samovar,
When inspired again, ecstatic,
When in the doorway, loudly, sweetly,
When I was but a little boy,
When I was young, a mere suggestion…’
When morning breezes filled the air, 
When my head ached so painfully?
When on the porch they said goodbye,
When passions’ flames have wavered,
33.When progress and enlightenment
50.When shall I ever loose my tether?
When, storm-wrapped, shall I be free
When suddenly they’re visited,
When talk was of some graver matter,
When their unbridled stirrings cease,
When the light has barely shown,
When through the thanksgiving Mass,
18.When to the flag we have gathered
When we met, long ago, by chance,
When we see him, when he’s near us,
When we see our lad approach,
When will my wings begin to soar?
When you were young, long ago,
When Zaretsky met his eyes.
Where, above shadowy waters blent,
Where are the horses taking him?
Where are you, now? It’s your right,
Where could be better? – Where there are none of us!
Where cupolas raise to glowing skies
Where days flowed by so lazily,
Where fashion’s loyal devotee 
Where French sounds were de rigeur,
Where had he come from, and when,
‘Where have you been, Onegin, where?
Where he his visitation made.
Where, held in the hands of destiny,
Where he’s no longer to be found,
Where his honoured dust now lies
Where I’m told I’m nothing new,
Where in cold blood opposing broods,
Where, in the shadow of the wings,
Where is he, now?’ ‘You’ll never guess,
Where is the storm of love’s extremes,
Where Italy’s gold nights descend,
Where I’ve loved, where I’ve suffered,
Where lovers of life’s simple pleasure
Where my heart has long been smothered. 
Where no face showed of Diana
Where now are the burning passions,
14.Where now, exchanging looks, the guests
‘Where, oh where have you vanished,
Where on blue ice-floes light-beams play,
Where only fair Terpsichore,
Where on quiet desert strands,
‘Where’s Anisya with the key?’
Where shall we find your like? 
Where Tanya met him, as we know.
Where Thalia is quietly napping,
Where the mute and blood-stained shade
Where the nightingale, spring’s lover,
Where the pensive dryads played. 
Where the ploughman likes to take
Where the roots are intertwined
Where the swan in beauty sails,
Where they fall, others flourish…
Where to? God knows. The trail is dead.
Where two shadowy pine trees grow,
Where we can…’ ‘Oh, an elegy!
Where will my young idler call?
Where you too were nourished or
Whether I fall struck by the power
Which Olga never would have read.
Which their friends will all endorse
Which to visit first? No matter,
Which translates as: he intends
Which was he? Mere imitation,
While age, in spectacles, can see
While a soft smile adorns her lips. 
While behind the window streams
While both indoors and outside
While Cicero I loathed, in truth;
While disillusion dogged him constantly,
While drowned by frantic violins
While Eugene, frozen, lingered on. 
While faster, stronger pounds her heart.
While fated everywhere to find,
While he devours her with his gaze.
While he is lost in reflection:
While, herald of the morning, lightly
While her eyes are drowned in tears.
While, holding him in such affection,
While Hussars, on leave, have but
While nurses screech, and infants roar.
While Onegin turns to Lensky:
While others sneered at the show,
While pointing out my famous bust.
While, quite the engineer, Zaretsky, 
37.While reading, on both mind and feeling,
While she gazes at the cover!
While such dreams pursue you,
While the babble of their wives,
While the breakfast is preparing,
While the girls recite old rhymes,
While the last has this reflection:
While the spouse, knowing her worth,
While they chew. All around,
While virtue won a noble crown.
While weary servants half-awake,
While we, of Hymen’s charms the foes,
While Zaretsky measures nicely,
While Zhukovsky’s Svetlana
Whispering solemnly together,
White Moscow, stone and blazing fire
Whitening the oak boughs, and fills
Who, as the years went by unsung,
Who but the hero of our novel? 
41.Who could have seen her silent pain,
‘Who’d have though it?’ – ‘What an age!
‘Whoever’s love for you’s more bright,
Who find November at the gate. 
Who freely, ardently, once wrote
Who has cooled love’s agitation
Who inspired such tenderness,
Who in this calm, majestic creature,
Who in your verse is your goddess?
Who is never bored by us?
8.Who is not bored with evasion,
Who is the man? Is this Eugene?
Who keep my pyramid from rust,
Who’ll be there? Just the family, 
Who’ll solemnly consider it,
Who longing to unite them, grieved
Whom did your dream reveal to you?’
‘Whom does your sweet lyre hold dearer?
Whom Epicurean maxims rule,
Who met with an untimely end,
Who mingled with some pure lament,
22.Whom to love, whom to believe in,
Whom we are obliged to cherish,
Who never harboured foolish fancies,
Who only ripened in good time;
Who pleased her very soul, a lover,
Who reads the works of his creation,
Who’s affectation caused occasion
Who’s dropped by accidentally,
Whose capital he’s proved able
58.‘Whose glance, creating inspiration,
Whose heart, experienced, grown chill,
Whose kind hand will smooth like down,
Who sends me to sleep, all were as one;
Whose rash look or sneer conflicts
Whose serfs live miserable lives;
Whose soul was formed in Göttingen,
Who showed him ambiguous respect.
Who’s not exhausted by their rages,
Who support us when we wander,
Who taught her this intense emotion,
Who to his grave the poet hurled?
Who will fit their speech and action,
Who will refrain from slander,
Who with radiant light would wrestle,
Why are you so unforgiving?
Why did you come, to disturb us?
14.‘Why did you leave so early,’ Olga
Why must you pursue me now?
Why not? It has a pleasant sound,
Why not view the house, or garden?
– Why not? – Well, I’d prefer her sister,
Why now pay me these attentions?
Why now? What brings you to my feet?
Why quarrel with the age fruitlessly?
“Why the devil can’t you die?”’
24.Why then consider Tanya guilty?
Wide gloomy brow and bicorn hat.
Wigs and scarlet-heeled shoes. 
Wilful, wild, but empty too…
Will at some far distant date,
Will be improved to take such loads:
Will halt her horse beside the stone,
Will know the secrets of death’s bourn;
Will not be picked apart again,
Will often food and drink rehearse,
Will slyly whisper, grinning fools…’
Will you not stop to shed a tear
Windows pale within, that fill
Wine by the bottle, never blinking,
Winter stalled its fall of snow 
2.Winter! ...The peasant with delight
Wish, dream, regret for what was gone,
Wished sincerely to acquire
34.Wishes, good health, felicity,
With a familiar melody:
With a hand he smoothes his hair,
With a large general in tow. 
With all its mysteries of home.
With all their mysteries laid bare;
With all their weary weight allotted.
With all the taste we used to see. 
With a Persian fabric spread,
With Aunt Pelageya Nikolevna
With children of all ages, say
With coaches, carriages and britzkas,
With copious hospitality.
With cruel joke, or lying oath!
With duelling, pistols, and the sword.
With Evil spirits, a lovely maiden;
With exclamations at her charms,
With fond indulgence; witty, tragic,
With friendship’s and wisdom’s pearls,
With glittering eyes Onegin there
With God knows who for neighbour,
With guests, may speak a word or two,
With her carpet, billowing where it lies,
With his offspring on display)
With his pawn took his own rook.
With his relations and his wife,
With icy baths his days begin,
Within, a rural landscape painted,
Within its glow no interest dawns,
With its hissing, foaming ways;
With Lensky’s fate pre-occupied;
With lines by Baratynsky too,
With many a solemn vow round about,
With no apparent consternation,
With not a thought in the morning
With old-fashioned hospitality.
Without a hint of hate or guile,
Without an aim on which to fix,
30.Without doubt, Eugene adores
(With Panil Kharlikov, who passes,
With parting, vengeance with a word,
With passion’s fire she is blazing,
With profound imagination,
With purer inspiration fired,
With quicker wits, might have guessed.
With Russian hammer, he’ll aspire
With sad expectancy would wait
With shadows all its gloomy space,
With sighs or flattery, to aspire
With solemn look, and sparkling eye.
With some dangerous volume roams,
With some fair Venetian face,
With some nonsense while your drinking,
With some ready epigram. 
With staple products its supply,
With starlit crowns; the track is gone;
With such ephemeral happiness,
With that her weary voice gave out;
With that my readers I’ll regale, 
With that pale diaphanous light,
With that secret, gave her dictat,
With the glasses’ clinking sound.
With the man of honour, and sighs;
With the others, sweetly dancing.
With the springtime showers again)
With too much life or wit, but charm. 
With tumult in his heart and head,
With vain ideas the brain conceives.
With vineyard, water, wood, and field,
With vulgar tales is coarse and bare.
With warmth a comrade’s manly kiss,
With what heavenly grace, advances,
With what strange languid agony,
With witticisms forged with guile,
With your pure and ardent mind;
With your self-image? He may offend
With your staff point out the way,
Women of a certain age,
Won’t kiss the ladies’ hands, what’s more
Won tributes of spontaneous tears,
Woods cloaked with a silver veil;
Wooed by all that ardent throng,
Words echoing there: Well and Killed. 
Words that flowed from my tongue,
Words upon his lips were still.
Wore the funeral crown at last.
Worn horns, and a dressing-gown;
36.Worn out by the ballroom’s noise
Worse, with a joyless madness
Would chase me about, fit to die.’
Would condemn me in that place,
Would give you notoriety,
Would haunt the grave, and shed a tear.
Would Hymen strew along our way,
Would join the literary bores,
Would meet in the morning, keen
Would recognise the tender girl?
Would soon settle his new wife)
Would thank the heavens for their fate.
Wrapped in mist and gloom, it seems
Write novels in established ways
Written by my pure young beauty,
X was a fine man, anyway.
Yawning the while as he raced,
Years long gone, now faded embers?
‘Yes, but who is she? – ‘That’s my wife.’ –
Yet, after brief greeting, to begin
Yet all too soon the summer ends,
Yet a modern Regulus, the soul
Yet as Albani might have done;
Yet (as all rules exceptions boast)
Yet at dawn the restless sleeper
Yet bored again by conquest’s mire; 
Yet brighter shines the moon by far
Yet built an eternal monument,
Yet diplomatic, held his tongue.
Yet had compassion a part to play
Yet he arrived, his uncle cold,
Yet he’d once set her heart awhirl!
Yet he is yours, through thick and thin,
‘Yet’, he reflects, ‘I must save her’,
 34.Yet her spouse loved her dearly,
32.Yet he stays; readier, it appears
Yet his life grew sad and cold. 
Yet, inclined to treat them lightly,
35.Yet in frozen winter time
Yet left Eugene, alone, dismayed,
Yet make the ladies smile, un-clam
27.Yet my Eugene’s preoccupation
Yet none of it, the whole display
11.Yet now, receiving Tanya’s note,
36.Yet now they’re near. Before them lies
Yet now we only see in her
Yet one keen gaze has settled on her,
Yet ours, though he may be one,
Yet prove as faithless….as their feet.
Yet revealing in his glance,
Yet she’d not a single trace
7.Yet she found a secret charm,
Yet, should you succeed, beware,
Yet sleep had barely laid its claim
Yet so be it: here I wait:
Yet Tanya scarcely seemed to grieve;
Yet Tasso’s murmured octaves are
Yet Terpsichore’s foot I’d seek
Yet the book has no pretension
Yet the most loyal, it’s expected,
Yet the one whom I set higher,
46.Yet to my stomach it’s a traitor,
Yet virgin hearts, despite its pain,
Yet were they wholly innocent
Yet within my heart’s confusion,
Yet wretched the man who foresees all,
Yet you’ll agree I hope, that diva,
Yevgeny heard with condescension,
Yevgeny read the gloomy note,
Yevgeny should have shown control,
Yevgeny, silently advances,
21.Yevgeny swiftly grasps a knife, 
Yevgeny took, in dreamy sessions,
Yields to it like a child, as yet
Yields to pensive idleness, 
You acolytes of Levshin’s school,
You acted rightly, in my cause,
You alone would be my wife.
You appeared, and instantly,
You appeared to me in dreams,
You bear no blame. I can’t forget,
‘You could afford a winter season,
You deeply, by my sad confession:
You don’t care for them a lot?
You fill my soul, and my blood!
You fortunate philosophers,
You fritter away your evenings?’
You, gleams of sacred poetry?
You handsome albums, illustrated
– ‘You know him then?’ ­ ‘Well, yes and no.’
(You know the fellow, right enough);
You left no trace, but loved instead
You’ll drink the poison love employs,
You’ll learn its bliss, its desires,
You’ll not find three lovely pair.
28.You’ll often have seen, of course,
You may consider unattractive,
You may trust through storms above,
You might enjoy it, so allow me,
You mothers, hear me too, I bid,
You must go, no matter what.’ –
You must go, they’d be delighted.
‘You must widen the net, my dear.
Young and fond, pursue again,
Young girls, hurrying, fell quiet;
Young girls kissing, noise and crushing.
Young poet of meditative thought,
You now consign your fate.
You, phantoms born of reverie,
You preached: the strong to the weak?
Your candour: that is dear to me,
You’re curious for every detail,
You’re in a fever…’ ‘No, I’m not ill:
18.‘You’re married then! I’d no idea!
1.‘You’re off again? Oh, these poets!’
You’re really going? And so swiftly?
– ‘You’re right, and so you’d show us,
You’re unsociable, they say
Your forbearance now I’ll crave,
Your grief, would never move my heart,
Your Olga, how’s Tatyana too?’
Your passion, letters and your tears.
Your perfection in all this;
Your poor Tanya, even now,
Your pride; these feelings shown.
Your pure, pensive incantation?
Your question ringing in my ear,
Your slightest glance; your smiling lips;
Your spirit’s true simplicity
Your tears, verse, et cetera, when? ...
Your three thousand year diploma!
Your true seducer in your mind. 
You rustic Priams, elemental,
You showed respect then…now you kneel.
Youth is a fever, let’s forgive
Youth slipped by, years to forget,
You too, familiar hills, I fear;
43.You too, sweet girls, who late at night,
You too Yevgeny quite deserted.
You’ve intoxicated me in style!
You visited them twice, and then
39-42.You were the first, capricious belles,
Zaretsky asked, ‘is your second?’
Zaretsky bites his lip, crossly,
Zaretsky establishes what’s what
Zaretsky, once a reprobate,
Zhukovsky
Zizi, the crystal of my soul,
